# docs: Write a concise subject for each commit

# Write capitalized imperative statement with no period for subject
# Leave an empty line between the subject and the body
# List details of significant changes below the subject line
# Write details as capitalized imperative statements
# Provide the below sections for further context

# Why:

# A short imperative subject helps when viewing the log, especially when
# viewing one-line formatted logs.  Clear writing of what changed helps
# give a clean understanding of context when reading blame messages and
# when looking at a specific commit.

# Related Issues:
# Link to related issue numbers (hyper link if applicable), e.g.:
# git issue 123

# References:
# List relevant references e.g.:
# https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

# Type can be
#    chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    revert   (reverts a previous commit)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
