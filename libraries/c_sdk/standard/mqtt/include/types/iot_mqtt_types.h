 *
 * #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryMs and #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit are only
 * relevant to QoS 1 PUBLISH messages. They are ignored for QoS 0 PUBLISH
 * messages and LWT messages. These members control retransmissions of QoS 1
 * messages under the following rules:
 * - Retransmission is disabled when #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is 0.
 * After sending the PUBLISH, the library will wait indefinitely for a PUBACK.
 * - If #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is greater than 0, then QoS 1 publishes
 * that do not receive a PUBACK within #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryMs will be
 * retransmitted, up to #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit times.
 *
 * Retransmission follows a truncated exponential backoff strategy. The constant
 * @ref IOT_MQTT_RETRY_MS_CEILING controls the maximum time between retransmissions.
 *
 * After #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit retransmissions are sent, the MQTT
 * library will wait @ref IOT_MQTT_RESPONSE_WAIT_MS before a final check
 * for a PUBACK. If no PUBACK was received within this time, the QoS 1 PUBLISH
 * fails with the code #IOT_MQTT_RETRY_NO_RESPONSE.
 *
 * @note The lengths of the strings in this struct should not include the NULL
 * terminator. Strings in this struct do not need to be NULL-terminated.
 *
 * @note The AWS IoT MQTT server does not support the DUP bit. When
 * [using this library with the AWS IoT MQTT server](@ref IotMqttConnectInfo_t.awsIotMqttMode),
 * retransmissions will instead be sent with a new packet identifier in the PUBLISH
 * packet. This is a nonstandard workaround. Note that this workaround has some
 * flaws, including the following:
 * - The previous packet identifier is forgotten, so if a PUBACK arrives for that
 * packet identifier, it will be ignored. On an exceptionally busy network, this
 * may cause excessive retransmissions when too many PUBACKS arrive after the
 * PUBLISH packet identifier is changed. However, the exponential backoff
 * retransmission strategy should mitigate this problem.
 * - Log messages will be printed using the new packet identifier; the old packet
 * identifier is not saved.
 *
 * <b>Example</b>
 *
 * Consider a situation where
 * - @ref IOT_MQTT_RETRY_MS_CEILING is 60000
 * - #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryMs is 2000
 * - #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is 20
 *
 * A PUBLISH message will be retransmitted at the following times after the initial
 * transmission if no PUBACK is received:
 * - 2000 ms (2000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 6000 ms (4000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 14000 ms (8000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 30000 ms (16000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 62000 ms (32000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 122000 ms, 182000 ms, 242000 ms... (every 60000 ms until 20 transmissions have been sent)
 *
 * After the 20th retransmission, the MQTT library will wait
 * @ref IOT_MQTT_RESPONSE_WAIT_MS before checking a final time for a PUBACK.

 * operation completes, a message is received on a topic filter, or an MQTT
 * connection is disconnected.
 *
 * The members of this struct are different based on the callback trigger. If the
 * callback function was triggered for completed operation, the `operation`
 * member is valid. Otherwise, if the callback was triggered because of a
 * server-to-client PUBLISH, the `message` member is valid. Finally, if the callback
 * was triggered because of a disconnect, the `disconnectReason` member is valid.
 *
 * For an incoming PUBLISH, the `message.pTopicFilter` parameter provides the
 * subscription topic filter that matched the topic name in the PUBLISH. Because
 * topic filters may use MQTT wildcards, the topic filter may be different from the
 * topic name. This pointer must be treated as read-only; the topic filter must not
 * be modified. Additionally, the topic filter may go out of scope as soon as the
 * callback function returns, so it must be copied if it is needed at a later time.
 *
 * @attention Any pointers in this callback parameter may be freed as soon as
 * the [callback function](@ref IotMqttCallbackInfo_t.function) returns.
 * Therefore, data must be copied if it is needed after the callback function
 * returns.
