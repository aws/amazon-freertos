 * @defgroup BufferPoolInterface The functions used by the MQTT client to get and return buffers.

 * The MQTT client needs buffers for both transmitting and receiving messages.

 * a buffer and after it is done it invokes mqttconfigRETURN_BUFFER_FXN to return the
 * buffer. By default, BUFFERPOOL_GetFreeBuffer and BUFFERPOOL_ReturnBuffer functions are
 * used to get and return buffers from the central buffer pool. The user can change the
 * buffer management functions for MQTT client by defining mqttconfigGET_FREE_BUFFER_FXN
 * and mqttconfigRETURN_BUFFER_FXN macros. The user should implement the two functions
 * having signatures same as BUFFERPOOL_GetFreeBuffer and BUFFERPOOL_ReturnBuffer and then
 * define the macros in BufferPoolConfig.h:
 * @code
 * uint8_t* UserDefined_GetFreeBuffer( uint32_t *pulBufferLength );
