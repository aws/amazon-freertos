 * @brief   iot_power_reset_mode is used to reset the mode (i,e remove the vote to set mode). When reset mode is called,
 *          its implicitly notifying the OS to enter deepest low power mode possible in idle state based on
 *          existing timers. If a set_mode is called with any of the performance modes with out calling reset_mode,
 *          then when target enters idle state, it will not be able to enter deep power states since there is an
 *          existing vote for a performance mode from the caller. The target will still do clock gating of the core
 *          by doing a WFI and WFE.
 *          Additionally, if a reset_mode is called, followed by a get_mode, eUnKnownMode will be returned to the caller.
 *          But if reset_mode is called, and then target enters idle state, when coming out of the idle_state it will resume
 *          to a known previous state.

 *          1. set_mode(eHighPerformanceMode)
 *          2. reset_modqe() -> At this point the current mode is set to eUnKnownMode
 *          3. Idle checks to see if it can enter a deep power state based on existing timers.
 *          4. If a callback is registered, the callback is called with bIdle set to "true"
 *          4a.  The callback can request a mode change causing idle to abort.
 *          5. Target enters Idle state and goes to 'some' deep power state
 *          6. Target wakes up due to external interrupt or scheduled timer interrupt.
 *          7. If a callback is registered, the callback is called with bIdle set to "false"
 *          8. At this point the caller can set the desired performance state.
 *          9. Target is set to eHighPerformanceMode as this was the known mode before entering idle. (optional if mode was not set at #6)
