@mainpage Overview
@brief 
The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. With FreeRTOS+POSIX, an existing POSIX compliant application can be easily ported to FreeRTOS ecosystem, and thus leveraging the entire AWS IoT service stack.<br><br>

FreeRTOS+POSIX partially implements IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 Edition The Open Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7. It currently supports:<br>

- errno.h
- fcntl.h
- mqueue.h
- pthread.h
- sched.h
- semaphore.h
- signal.h
- sys/types.h
- time.h
- unistd.h

Please see each above header file for detailed FreeRTOS+POSIX implementation of POSIX.

To adopt FreeRTOS+POSIX in your project, these porting related header files are needed.
| FreeRTOS platform specific POSIX configuration | High Level Description |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| FreeRTOS_POSIX.h.                              | This header file brings in dependencies required by FreeRTOS+POSIX. This file must be included before all other FreeRTOS+POSIX includes. |
| FreeRTOS_POSIX_portable_default.h              | Defaults for port-specific configuration of FreeRTOS+POSIX. |
| FreeRTOS_POSIX_portable.h                      | Port-specific configuration overwrite of FreeRTOS+POSIX. As an example, /lib/FreeRTOS-Plus-POSIX/include/portable/pc/windows/FreeRTOS_POSIX_portable.h, Windows simulator uses the defaults, thus does not need to overwrite anything. |
