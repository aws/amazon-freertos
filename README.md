# FreeRTOS AWS Reference Integrations

## Cloning
This repo uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in dependent components.

Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI, you will not get the contents of the submodules. (The ZIP file is also not a valid git repository)

If using Windows, because this repository and its submodules contain symbolic links, set `core.symlinks` to true with the following command:
```
git config --global core.symlinks true
```
In addition to this, either enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) or, whenever using a git command that writes to the system (e.g. `git pull`, `git clone`, and `git submodule update --init --recursive`), use a console elevated as administrator so that git can properly create symbolic links for this repository. Otherwise, symbolic links will be written as normal files with the symbolic links' paths in them as text. [This](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/) gives more explanation.

To clone using HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos.git --recurse-submodules
```
Using SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:aws/amazon-freertos.git --recurse-submodules
```

If you have downloaded the repo without using the `--recurse-submodules` argument, you need to run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### AWS Collection of Metrics

The demos that connect to AWS IoT report metrics to AWS about the operating system, and the MQTT client library used by sending a specially formatted string in the username field of the MQTT CONNECT packet. These metrics help AWS IoT improve security and provide better technical support. Providing these metrics is optional for users, and these can be disabled by updating the following configuration macros in the `demos/include/aws_iot_metrics.h` file:

```
#define AWS_IOT_METRICS_STRING           NULL
#define AWS_IOT_METRICS_STRING_LENGTH    0U
```

#### Format

The format of the username string with metrics is:

```
<Actual_Username>?SDK=<OS_Name>&Version=<OS_Version>MQTTLib=<MQTT_Library_name>@<MQTT_Library_version>
```

where

* **Actual_Username** is the actual username used for authentication (if a username/password is used for authentication).
* **OS_Name** is the Operating System the application is running on.
* **OS_Version** is the version number of the Operating System.
* **MQTT_Library_name** is the MQTT Client library being used.
* **MQTT_Library_version** is the version of the MQTT Client library being used.
