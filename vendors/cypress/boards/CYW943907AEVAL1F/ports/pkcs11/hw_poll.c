/* For best security practice, it is recommended to utilize a random number
 * generation solution that is truly randomized and conforms to the guidelines
 * provided in the Amazon FreeRTOS Qualification Guide
 * (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/qualificationguide/afq-checklist.html).
 * The random number generator method presented in this file by the silicon vendor
 * is not truly random in nature. The current solution takes entropy from
 * WLAN Firmware generated random number and the CPU ticks.
 * Please contact the silicon vendor for details regarding the method implemented.
