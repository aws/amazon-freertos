# CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT BSP Release Notes
The PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of the PSoC 62 MCU (CY8C6247BZI-D54) and the Murata LBEE5KL1DX Module (CYW4343W WiFi + Bluetooth Combo Chip).

NOTE: BSPs are versioned by family. This means that version 1.2.0 of any BSP in a family (eg: PSoC 6) will have the same software maturity level. However, not all updates are necessarily applicable for each BSP in the family so not all version numbers will exist for each board. Additionally, new BSPs may not start at version 1.0.0. In the event of adding a common feature across all BSPs, the libraries are assigned the same version number. For example if BSP_A is at v1.3.0 and BSP_B is at v1.2.0, the event will trigger a version update to v1.4.0 for both BSP_A and BSP_B. This allows the common feature to be tracked in a consistent way.

### What's Included?
The CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* CM4 Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, ARM toolchains
* CM0+ Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation

### What Changed?
#### v1.3.0
* Minor update for documentation & branding
* Updated design files to use latest personality files
* Initialize VDDA voltage if set in configurator
NOTE: This requires psoc6hal 1.3.0 or later
#### v1.2.1
* Added 43012/4343W/43438 component to appropriate BSPs
* Added multi-image policy for secure (064) BSPs
#### v1.2.0
* Standardize version numbering for all boards in a family
* Moved UDB SDIO implementation into its own library udb-sdio-whd library
* Added call to setup HAL SysPM driver (requires HAL 1.2.0 or later)
* Updated documentation
NOTE: This requires psoc6hal 1.2.0 or later
#### v1.1.0
* Updated linker scripts and startup code for the CM0+ and CM4 cores. The files are now in core specific directories.
* Minor updates to avoid potential warnings on some toolchains
#### v1.0.1
* Added pin references for the board's J2 Header (for appropriate boards)
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release
