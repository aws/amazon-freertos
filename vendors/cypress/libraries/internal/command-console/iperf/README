This is Iperf v2.0.5.WICED, a tool for measuring Internet bandwidth performance.
See the doc directory for more documentation.
Briefly:

  ./configure      -- configure for your machine
  make             -- compile Iperf
  make install     -- install Iperf, if desired

  iperf -s               (on machine "foo.bar.edu")
  iperf -c foo.bar.edu   (on some other machine)
  iperf -h               (for help screen)
  iperf -v               (for version information)

This is a port of iperf to the WICED platform. The porting was done by Joshua
Spence in December 2011. The version number has been changed from v2.0.5 (that
of the base source code) to v2.0.5.WICED to signify the changes and bugfixes that 
have been applied.

The contents of this directory contain the necessary source files to build iperf
for Unix, Windows and the WICED platform. Windows builds are possible under
both cygwin and minGW. Windows and Unix builds should use the configure script
to check for required dependencies and to generate a config.h file for the host
machine. WICED builds need not use the configure script and instead should use
the WICED makefile (`wiced.mk') to build iperf.


As the RTOS's provide no separate stack or heap space for a thread, nor do they
keep track of memory which a thread has allocated, there is no reliable or 
clean way to prematurely terminate a command. For this reason, no functionality
has been provided to terminate a WICED iperf server (which will never terminate
of its own accord).

In order to disable features of iperf that would not function correctly on the
WICED platform (due either to missing dependencies or to meaningless operations 
such as file I/O), preprocessor defines taking the form of NO_XXX (where XXX is
the disabled feature) are used to disable such un-needed functionality from the
WICED iperf builds. The defining of these disabling macros is done in the 
`inc/headers.h' file upoon recognition of a WICED build.

The raw iperf 2.0.5 source code had some well known bugs which had been 
documented on iperf's SourceForge page. Most of these bugs have been patched,
using patches provided by other uses on the SourceForge page. The patched bugs
are detailed below.

The default buffer size has been reduced from 128KB to 1KB. This affects the 
WICED iperf build only. The WICED platform cannot be expected to have enough 
free space on the heap for 128KB buffers, and so this was arbitrarily reduced to
1KB. This didn't seem to have any noticeable impact on performance.

ADDITIONS:
* Added debug macros that describe various states and actions of iperf clients,
  servers, etc. See debug.h for more information.

BUGS FIXES:
* There was a seemingly undocumented feature of iperf known as "single client
  mode", specified using the `-1' or `--singleclient' command line arguments.
  This feature does not appear in any iperf documentation, and similarly does 
  not appear to have any real effect on program execution. Hence, I decide to 
  implement this rather simple feature which, based purely on an interpretation
  of the feature's name, should cause an iperf server to terminate (exit 
  cleanly) after a single iperf client has connected and erformed a bandwidth 
  test. This feature has been implemented on Unix, Windows and WICED iperf 
  builds.
* Fixed a bug which prevented iperf from sleeping for less than one millisecond.
  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/85122/sleep-less-than-one-millisecond
* Added guard include statements whenever `config.h" was included into a source
  file. The auto-generated `config.h" file doesn't include any guard include
  directives, and this caused problems with the WICED iperf build. 
* Added a setitimer implementation for Windows.
* Added a reset function to GNU getopt functionality. This is needed for a
  WICED iperf build because the program is always in memory and hence the static
  variables will never be reset otherwise.
* Fixed the incorrect use of `new'/`delete' to allocate/deallocate memory for a 
  C struct.
* Fixed a bug in which iperf was unable to check for an erroneous return value
  from a call to `write()'. See 
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3454612&group_id=128336&atid=711373
* Fixed a bug which caused an iperf server to terminate unexpectedly. See
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1983829&group_id=128336&atid=711371
* Fixed a bug in which iperf would not free memory associated with multi
  reports. See http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1852136&group_id=128336&atid=711371
* Fixed bug with iperf not handling large time values correctly. See
  http://bugs.debian.org/346099
* Fixed some typos.
* Fixed hyphen used as minus sign in manpages.
* Fix bug with iperf trying to continue execution when binding to a port fails.

NOTES AND LIMITATIONS:
* File input and output has been disabled for the WICED iperf build as it does
  not make sense for the WICED platform.
* Standard input is disabled for the WICED iperf build.
* Daemon mode is disabled on WICED iperf build as it does not make sense for 
  the WICED platform.
* There is no interpretation of environment variables under the WICED iperf 
  build as it does not make sense for the WICED platform.
* The WICED iperf app is currently single-threaded only. A multithreading 
  implementation has been started (but not completed nor tested) and can be 
  found in the `wiced' directory. Basically, in order to complete multithreading
  capability for a WICED iperf build, someone must provide a FreeRTOS/ThreadX 
  implementation of iperf's rather abstract threads, conditions and mutexes.
* Signals (such as SIGINT and SIGKILL) have been disabled on a WICED iperf build
  as they do not make sense for the WICED platform.
* On LwIP, there is no function to set the TCP window size. As a result, the TCP
  window size may be reported by iperf as either `-1' or `0'.
* On a WICED iperf build, any time values reported by the RTOS are not "real" 
  time values, but rather are measured relative to the uptime of the hardware.
* On a WICED iperf build, we are currently unable to run WICED iperf client with
  dualtest `-d' option because this option is unavailable in a single threaded 
  version of iperf.
* Currently unable to run WICED iperf client with parallel `-P' option because 
  this option is unavailable in a single threaded version of iperf.
* FreeRTOS does not support TCP_MAXSEG. If running a WICED iperf client with the
  `-m' option, iperf will warn that "MSS and MTU size unknown (TCP_MAXSEG not 
  supported by OS?)".
