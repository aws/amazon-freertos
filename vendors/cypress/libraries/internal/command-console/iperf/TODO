 
 * Having two iperf clients simultaneously connecting to a WICED iperf server 
  does not function as expected.
  
* Trying to connect three or more iperf clients to a WICED iperf server 
  simultaneously will cause undefined behaviour.
  
* Similarly to the two above-mentioned bugs, the `-P' flag will not work when
  connecting to a WICED iperf server.
  
* Unable to set the MSS value using `-M' parameter using LwIP.

* There seems to sometimes be a thread-related bug when running under Unix. See
  Valgrind output below.

* I am unsure if the 'TCP window size' and 'UDP buffer size' reported by iperf
  running on WICED are correct. Since (using LwIP at least) we are unable to
  retrieve these values using the conventional `getsockopt' function, I had to
  hard-code the values.
  
* UDP TX performance on Windows seems to be extremely poor. Whilst Windows seems
  to be able to maintain the specified transmission rate (specified using the 
  `-b' parameter), a large number of packets are dropped somewhere and do not
  reach the server.
  
* Windows build exits early when doing a bidirectional speed test.
