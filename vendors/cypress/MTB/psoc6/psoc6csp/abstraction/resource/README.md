# Cypress Resource Abstraction

## Overview

The Resource Abstraction APIs provide read only access to data stored in none volatile memory at build time.

To use the Resource Abstraction, simply include a reference to `cyabs_resource.h`.

## Features

* Block level APIs for accessing resources stored in memory
* Implementation for accessing Memory Mapped data (Flash or XIP)
* Allows middleware to be written without knowing how data is actually stored in memory
