# Cypress CapSense Middleware Library

### Overview
CapSense is a Cypress capacitive sensing solution. Capacitive sensing can be used in a variety of applications and products where conventional mechanical buttons can be replaced with sleek human interfaces to transform the way users interact with electronic systems. These include home appliances, and automotive, IoT, and industrial applications. CapSense supports multiple interfaces (widgets) using both Self-Capacitance (CSD) and Mutual-Capacitance (CSX) sensing methods with robust performance.

CapSense has become a popular technology to replace conventional mechanical- and optical-based user interfaces. There are fewer parts involved, which saves cost and increases reliability with no wear-and-tear. The main advantages of CapSense compared with other solutions are: robust performance in harsh environmental conditions and rejection of a wide range of external noise sources.

Use CapSense for:
* Touch and gesture detection for various interfaces
* Proximity detection for innovative user experiences and low-power optimization
* Contactless liquid-level sensing in a variety of applications
* Touch-free operations in hazardous materials

### Quick Start
The [ModusToolbox CapSense Configurator Tool Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) describes step-by-step instructions how to configure and launch CapSense in [ModusToolbox](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment). The CapSense Configurator Tool can be launched in ModusToolbox IDE from the CSD personality, as well as in stand-alone mode. Refer to [ModusToolbox Software Environment, Quick Start Guide, Documentation, and Videos](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment).
