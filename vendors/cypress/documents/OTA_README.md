# AWS IoT and FreeRTOS: Over-the-Air Update

This release supports OTA firmware update using FreeRTOS for PSoC® 62 MCUs with 2M internal flash and CYW43xxx connectivity devices.

Current revision: OTA V2.1.1

## Supported Kits

- [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) (CY8CPROTO-062-4343W)
- [PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012) (CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)
- [PSoC® 64 Standard Secure - AWS Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit ](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-64-standard-secure-aws-wi-fi-bt-pioneer-kit-cy8ckit) (CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W)

Only PSoC® 62 MCU kits with 2 MB of Internal flash are supported at this time.

PSoC® 62 MCU kit-specific things that need to be changed:

- Flash locations and sizes for Bootloader, Primary Slot (slot 0), and Secondary Slot (slot 1).
  - See further information in the Configure MCUBootApp section below.

## Features and Functionality

This library utilizes MQTT or HTTP and TLS to securely connect to AWS and download an update for the user application.

Once the application starts the OTA agent, the OTA agent will contact the MQTT Broker to see if there is an update available. If an update is available, it will be downloaded.

## Requirements

- [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.1 or later
- [MCUBoot](https://juullabs-oss.github.io/mcuboot/)
- Programming Language: C
- [Python 3.7 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads//) (for signing script)
  - Run pip to install the modules.

```
pip install -r <repo root>/vendors/cypress/MTB/port_support/ota/scripts/requirements.txt
```

## Supported Toolchains

- GCC ARM Compiler
- ARM C Compiler
  - NOTE: When using the ARM Compiler, add the GCC compiler directory to your system PATH.
- IAR Compiler
  - NOTE: When using the IAR Compiler, add the GCC compiler directory to your system PATH.

## Supported RTOS

- Amazon FreeRTOS

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

- Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).
- Python Interpreter. The supplied publisher.py is tested with [Python 3.8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/). Note that ModusToolbox Windows installations include a Python Interpreter which can be accessed by using the ModusToolbox shell; Mac OS and Linux installations will have their own Python installations. You can check your Python installation version by running "python --version".

## Clone MCUBoot (PSoC® 62 MCU kits)

We need to first build and program the bootloader app *MCUBootApp* that is available in the MCUBoot GitHub repo, before programming this OTA app. The bootloader app is run by CM0+ while this OTA app is run by CM4. Clone the MCUBoot repository onto your local machine, **outside of your application directory.**

1. git clone https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot.git

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the cloned mcuboot folder: `cd mcuboot`

3. Change the branch to get the Cypress version: `git checkout v1.6.1-cypress`

4. We need to pull in mcuboot sub-modules to build mcuboot: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

5. Install the required python packages mentioned in *mcuboot\scripts\requirements.txt*.
   Note this step is required on all operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
   
   i. cd `mcuboot/scripts` 

   ii. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configure MCUBootApp (PSoC® 62 MCU kits)

#### Adjust MCUBootApp RAM start in linker script

The default RAM location needs to be modified for use with OTA.

1. Edit *mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/MCUBootApp.ld*

   `Change at line 66 from:`

   `    ram               (rwx)   : ORIGIN = 0x08020000, LENGTH = 0x20000`

   To:

   `    ram               (rwx)   : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 0x20000`

#### Adjust MCUBootApp Flash Locations

It is important for both MCUBootApp and the OTA application to have the exact same understanding of the memory layout. Otherwise, the bootloader may consider an authentic image as invalid. To learn more about the bootloader refer to the [MCUBoot](https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot/blob/cypress/docs/design.md) documentation. 

#### Internal Flash for Secondary Slot

These values are used when the Secondary Slot is located in **internal** flash. Since internal flash is 2 MB, we need to have the bootloader and the Primary and Secondary slots fit. The Primary and Secondary slots are always the same size.

1. Edit *mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/MCUBootApp.mk*

   Change at line 31:

   ```
USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH ?= 0
   ```

   Replace line 55 with:

   ```
DEFINES_APP +=-DMCUBOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS=2000
   ```
   
   Add at line 56:
   
   ```
   DEFINES_APP +=-DCY_BOOT_PRIMARY_1_SIZE=0x0EE000
   DEFINES_APP +=-DCY_BOOT_SECONDARY_1_SIZE=0x0EE000
   ```
   
   

#### External Flash for Secondary Slot

These values are used when the Secondary Slot is located in **external** flash. This allows for a larger Primary Slot and hence, a larger application size. The Primary and Secondary slots are always the same size.

1. Edit *mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/MCUBootApp.mk*

   Change at line 31:

   ```
USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH ?= 1
   ```

   Replace line 55 with:
   
   ```
   DEFINES_APP +=-DMCUBOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS=3584
   ```
   
   Add at line 56:
   
   ```
   DEFINES_APP +=-DCY_BOOT_PRIMARY_1_SIZE=0x01c0000
   DEFINES_APP +=-DCY_BOOT_SECONDARY_1_SIZE=0x01c00=00
   ```

### Configure MCUBoot to Ignore Primary Slot Verify

The Primary Slot is where the application is run from and the OTA download is saved to the Secondary Slot. MCUBoot verifies the signature in the Secondary Slot before copying to Primary slot. Signature verify takes some time. Removing the verify for the Primary slot allows for a faster bring up of your application. 

Make the following changes in *mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/config/mcuboot_config/mcuboot_config.h* to disable signature verification for primary slot. 

1. Comment out lines 38 & 39

   `/* Uncomment for ECDSA signatures using curve P-256. */`

   `//#define MCUBOOT_SIGN_EC256`

   `//#define NUM_ECC_BYTES (256 / 8) 	// P-256 curve size in bytes, rnok: to make compilable`

2. Comment out line 78

   `//#define MCUBOOT_VALIDATE_PRIMARY_SLOT`

## Build and Program MCUBootApp (PSoC® 62 MCU kits)

### Build MCUBootApp

1. Ensure that the toolchain path is set for the compiler. Check that the path is correct for your installed version of ModusToolbox.

​		`export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=<path>/ModusToolbox/tools_2.1/gcc-7.2.1`

2. Build the Application

​		`cd mcuboot/boot/cypress`

​		`make app APP_NAME=MCUBootApp TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W`

​		Use the following command if you are using Cygwin: 

​		`make app APP_NAME=MCUBootApp PLATFORM=PSOC_062_2M CURDIR=$(cygpath --mixed $(pwd))`

### Program MCUBootApp

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use Cypress Programmer to program MCUBootApp. Remember to close Cypress Programmer before trying to program the application using ModusToolbox or from the CLI. The MCUBootApp.elf file is at:

   ​		`mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/out/PSOC_062_2M/Debug/MCUBootApp.elf`

## Prepare for Building your OTA Application (PSoC® 62 MCU kits)

Ensure that the OTA_SUPPORT flag is set to 1. Depending on your flow this could be with "set(OTA_SUPPORT 1)" in your cmake list, or by defining this on a command line build with "-DOTA_SUPPORT=1"

The Makefile and cmake flows both look for this environment variable to determine how to build the application:

`OTA_USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH`

The default for the build is to use external flash. If the environment variable is undefined or is non-zero, the application will build for external flash. The build system will use the values described above for the slot sizes automatically.

To use internal FLASH only, set the environment variable to zero

`> export OTA_USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH=0`

## Flash Partitioning (PSoC® 62 MCU kits)

OTA provides a way to update the system software. The OTA mechanism stores the new software to a "staging" area called the Secondary Slot.  MCUboot will do the actual update from the Secondary Slot to the Primary Slot on the next reboot of the device. In order for the OTA software and MCUBoot to have the same information on where the two Slots are in FLASH, we need to tell MCUBoot where the Slots are located. 

Secondary slot can be placed on either Internal or external flash. The start address when internal flash is used is an offset from the starting address of the internal flash 0x10000000.

Internal flash:

Primary Slot      (Slot 0): start: 0x018000, size: 0xEE000

Secondary Slot (Slot 1): start: 0x106000, size: 0xEE000

External flash:

Primary Slot      (Slot 0): start: 0x018000, size: 0x01c0000

Secondary Slot (Slot 1): start: 0x18000000, size: 0x01c0000

## Prepare for Building your OTA Application (PSoC® 64 MCU kits)

For PSoC® 064 kits, mcuboot is installed in the device when the provisioning step is run using cysecuretools.
The PSoC® 064 aws_demos Makefile and cmake flows have CY_MCUBOOT_SWAP_USING_STATUS defined as default.

## Flash Partitioning (PSoC® 64 MCU kits)

The slots are specified by the bootloader and are not changeable.

Primary Slot   CM0 code: start: 0x10000000, size: 0x00050000    - Internal FLASH
Primary Slot   CM4 code: start: 0x10050000, size: 0x0011C000    - Internal FLASH

Secondary Slot CM0 code: start: 0x1016C000, size: 0x00050000    - Internal FLASH
Secondary Slot CM4 code: start: 0x18024400, size: 0x0011C000    - External FLASH

## Limitations
1. Be sure to have a reliable network connection before starting an OTA update. If your Network connection is poor, OTA update may fail due to lost packets or lost connection.

4. Be sure to have a fully charged device before starting an OTA update. If you device's battery is low, OTA may fail.
