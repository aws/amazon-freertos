WicedFS_Test - Verification Test Tool for Wiced Read Only File-System
=====================================================================

This directory contains source code for a tool which verifies the functionality of the WicedFS API.

The makefile generates two executables - with and without 64-bit support. (64 Bit support is required for files over 2GB)

The tool takes an existing directory on the host PC and creates a WicedFS filesystem image which contains all
the files and subdirectories of the supplied directory. It then uses the WicedFS API to read files from the
created filesystem and compare them to the Host PC.
