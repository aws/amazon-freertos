 * @brief ChaCha20 is a stream cipher developed by Daniel J. Bernstein based on the 20-round cipher Salsa20/20.
 */
/**@file
 * A 256-bit key is expanded into 2^64 randomly accessible streams, each
 * containing 2^64 randomly accessible 64-byte (512 bits) blocks.
 *
 * The changes from Salsa20/20 to ChaCha20 are designed to improve diffusion per
 * round, conjecturally increasing resistance to cryptanalysis, while
 * preserving - and often improving - time per round.
