/**@file
 * SRP is an augmented password-authenticated key agreement protocol,
 * specifically designed to work around existing patents. SRP allows the use of
 * user names and passwords over unencrypted channels and supplies a shared
 * secret at the end of the authentication sequence that can be used to generate
 * encryption keys.
 *
 * An eavesdropper or man in the middle cannot obtain enough information to be
 * able to brute force guess a password without further interactions with the
 * parties for each guess.
 *
 * The server does not store password-equivalent data. This means that an
 * attacker who steals the server data cannot masquerade as the client unless
 * they first perform a brute force search for the password.
 *
 * The specific variant implemented here is SRP-6 3072 bit SHA-512 as mandated
 * by Apple for use with HomeKit.
 *
 * @see [RFC 5054 - Using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) Protocol for TLS Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054)
 * @see [The Stanford SRP Homepage](http://srp.stanford.edu)
 *
 * **Basic protocol overview**
 *
 * *Setup*
 * 1. Server generates a username / password combination together with a salt.
 * 2. Server derives a password verifier (see #occ_srp_verifier).
 * 3. The username, salt and verifier are stored and required to open sessions.
 *    The original password is no longer needed.
 *
 * *Session opening*
 * 1. Client sends a username and the public key of an ephemeral key pair to the
 *    server.
 * 2. Server sends the salt and the public key of another ephemeral key pair to
 *    the client (see #occ_srp_public_key).
 * 3. Client and Server both compute the session key from this information (see
 *    #occ_srp_scrambling_parameter, #occ_srp_premaster_secret,
 *    #occ_srp_session_key).
 * 4. Client sends proof of the session key to the server.
 * 5. Server validates proof (see #occ_srp_proof_m1), then sends proof of the 
 *    session key to the client (see #occ_srp_proof_m2).
 * 6. Client validates proof. Both parties know that they share the same private
 *    session key.
