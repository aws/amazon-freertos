 * Based on this notification, the NFC BSP Module sets the NFCT peripheral as a wakeup source
 * through the Board Support Package. Additionally, any BSP Button can be configured to
 * generate BSP sleep events. This module is applicable only if NFCT is used exclusively for
 * wakeup. If NFCT is used for a different purpose, this module cannot be used.
