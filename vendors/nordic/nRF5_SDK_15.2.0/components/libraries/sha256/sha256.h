 *
 * @brief  This module calculates SHA-256 (SHA-2, FIPS-180) hashes.
 *
 * @details To use this module, first call @ref sha256_init on a @ref sha256_context_t instance. Then call @ref
 *          sha256_update with the data to be hashed. This step can optionally be done with multiple
 *          calls to @ref sha256_update, each with a section of the data (in the correct order).
 *          After all data has been passed to @ref sha256_update, call @ref sha256_final to finalize
 *          and extract the hash value.
 *
 *          This code is adapted from code by Brad Conte, retrieved from
 *          https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms.
