 * @brief Module for generating a pulse-width modulated output signal.
 *
 * @details This module provides a PWM implementation using timers, GPIOTE, and PPI.
 *
 * Resource usage:
 * - 2 PPI channels per instance + 2 PPI channels per PWM channel.
 * - 1 PPI group per instance.
 * - 1 GPIOTE channel per PWM channel.
 *
 * For example, a PWM instance with two channels will consume 2 + 4 PPI channels, 1 PPI group, and 2 GPIOTE channels.
 *
 * The maximum number of PWM channels per instance is 2.
