 *
 * @brief Buttons handling module.
 *
 * @details The button handler uses the @ref app_gpiote to detect that a button has been
 *          pushed. To handle debouncing, it will start a timer in the GPIOTE event handler.
 *          The button will only be reported as pushed if the corresponding pin is still active when
 *          the timer expires. If there is a new GPIOTE event while the timer is running, the timer
 *          is restarted.
 *
 * @note    The app_button module uses the app_timer module. The user must ensure that the queue in
 *          app_timer is large enough to hold the app_timer_stop() / app_timer_start() operations
 *          which will be executed on each event from GPIOTE module (2 operations), as well as other
 *          app_timer operations queued simultaneously in the application.
 *
 * @note    Even if the scheduler is not used, app_button.h will include app_scheduler.h, so when
 *          compiling, app_scheduler.h must be available in one of the compiler include paths.
