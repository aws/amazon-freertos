 * @brief Module for writing and reading flags that are associated
 *        with keys.
 *
 * @details The flags are represented as bits in a bitmap called a <i>flag collection</i>. The keys
 *          are uint16_t. Each flag collection contains all flags of the same type, one flag for
 *          each key.
 *
 *          The mapped flags module does not keep the flag states, nor the list of keys. These are
 *          provided in the API calls. A key's index in the key list determines which bit in the
 *          flag collection is associated with it. This module does not ever edit the key list, and
 *          does not edit flags except in function calls that take the flag collection as a pointer.
