 *
 * @brief Memory pool implementation
 *
 * Memory pool implementation, based on circular buffer data structure, which supports asynchronous
 * processing of RX data. The current default implementation supports 1 TX buffer and 4 RX buffers.
 * The memory managed by the pool is allocated from static storage instead of heap. The internal
 * design of the circular buffer implementing the RX memory layout is illustrated in the picture
 * below.
 *
 * @image html memory_pool.svg "Circular buffer design"
 *
 * The expected call order for the RX APIs is as follows:
 * - hci_mem_pool_rx_produce
 * - hci_mem_pool_rx_data_size_set
 * - hci_mem_pool_rx_extract
 * - hci_mem_pool_rx_consume
 *
 * @warning If the above mentioned expected call order is violated the end result can be undefined.
 *
 * \par Component specific configuration options
 *
 * The following compile time configuration options are available to suit various implementations:
 * - TX_BUF_SIZE TX buffer size in bytes.
 * - RX_BUF_SIZE RX buffer size in bytes.
 * - RX_BUF_QUEUE_SIZE RX buffer element size.
