 * @{
 * @ingroup app_common
 *
 * @brief The scheduler is used for transferring execution from the interrupt context to the main
 *        context.
 *
 * @details See @ref seq_diagrams_sched for sequence diagrams illustrating the flow of events
 *          when using the Scheduler.
 *
 * @section app_scheduler_req Requirements:
 *
 * @subsection main_context_logic Logic in main context:
 *
 *   - Define an event handler for each type of event expected.
 *   - Initialize the scheduler by calling the APP_SCHED_INIT() macro before entering the
 *     application main loop.
 *   - Call app_sched_execute() from the main loop each time the application wakes up because of an
 *     event (typically when sd_app_evt_wait() returns).
 *
 * @subsection int_context_logic Logic in interrupt context:
 *
 *   - In the interrupt handler, call app_sched_event_put()
 *     with the appropriate data and event handler. This will insert an event into the
 *     scheduler's queue. The app_sched_execute() function will pull this event and call its
 *     handler in the main context.
 *
 * @if (PERIPHERAL)
 * For an example usage of the scheduler, see the implementations of
 * @ref ble_sdk_app_hids_mouse and @ref ble_sdk_app_hids_keyboard.
