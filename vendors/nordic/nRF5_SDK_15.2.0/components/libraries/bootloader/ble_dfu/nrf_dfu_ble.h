 * @brief    Device Firmware Update (DFU) transport layer for <em>Bluetooth</em> low energy.
 *
 * @details  The Device Firmware Update (DFU) Service is a GATT-based service that can be used for
 *           performing firmware updates over BLE. Note that this implementation uses
 *           vendor-specific UUIDs for the service and characteristics, and is intended to demonstrate
 *           firmware updates over BLE. See @ref lib_dfu_transport_ble "DFU Transport: BLE" for more information on the service and the profile.
