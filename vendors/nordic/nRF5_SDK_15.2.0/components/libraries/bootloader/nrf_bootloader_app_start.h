/**@brief Function for using hardware to protect flash from writing and reading.
 *
 * @details This function will apply write/erase protection to a specific area. Read
 *          protection is optional, decided by \p read_protect. This function uses
 *          the BPROT or ACL peripheral, depending on which is available.
 *
 * @param[in]  address       The start address of the area to protect. Must be a flash page
 *                           boundary.
 * @param[in]  size          The size of the area to protect, in bytes. Must be a multiple
 *                           of flash page size.
 * @param[in]  read_protect  Whether to protect the area from reading/executing as well.
 *                           This is not available on chips with the BPROT peripheral
 *                           (e.g. nrf52832, nrf52810).
 *
 * @retval  NRF_SUCCESS              Flash protection applied successfully.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_NO_MEM         No more ACL instances to use for flash protection.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM  Address was out of range or size was not a multiple
 *                                   of flash page size.

/**@brief Function for starting another application (and aborting the current one).

 *          (thread/handler). If in thread mode, it resets into the other application.
 *          If in handler mode, isr_abort is executed to ensure that handler mode is left correctly.

 * @note This function will never return, but issues a reset into the provided application.
