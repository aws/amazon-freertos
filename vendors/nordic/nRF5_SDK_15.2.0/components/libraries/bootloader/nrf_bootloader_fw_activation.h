/** @brief Function for activating a firmware received during DFU.
 *
 * @details     This function initiates or continues the DFU copy-back
 *              routines. These routines are fail-safe operations to activate
 *              either a new SoftDevice, bootloader, combination of SoftDevice and
 *              bootloader, or a new application.
 *
 * @details     This function relies on accessing MBR commands through supervisor calls.
 *              It does not rely on the SoftDevice for flash operations.
 *
 * @note        When updating the bootloader or both bootloader and SoftDevice in combination,
 *              this function does not return, but rather initiates a reboot to activate
 *              the new bootloader.
 *
 * @retval  ACTIVATION_NONE                              If no update was found.
 * @retval  ACTIVATION_SUCCESS                           If the firmware update was successfully activated.
 * @retval  ACTIVATION_SUCCESS_EXPECT_ADDITIONAL_UPDATE  If the firmware update was successfully activated,
 *                                                       but there are likely more updates to be transferred.
 * @retval  ACTIVATION_ERROR                             If the firmware update could not be activated.
