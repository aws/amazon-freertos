/**
 * @brief Integrated HKDF calculation function
 *
 * @details This HKDF calculation function uses the nrf_crypto HMAC frontend directly.
 *          The backend is selected by configuring the HMAC backend in @ref sdk_config.
 *
 * @param[in,out]  p_context        Pointer to context structure. Context memory will be
 *                                  allocated internally if the context pointer is NULL.
 * @param[in]      p_info           Pointer to static info structure. This defines the algorithm.
 *                                  This should be either @ref g_nrf_crypto_hmac_sha256_info or
 *                                  @ref g_nrf_crypto_hmac_sha512_info.
 * @param[out]     p_output_key     Pointer to buffer to hold the output key material.
 * @param[in,out]  p_output_key_size Pointer to the length of the wanted output key material as input
 *                                  and actual length of the output material as output. Can be any
 *                                  number between 1 and the hash digest size multiplied by 255
 *                                  (65280 for SHA-256 or 130560 for SHA-512). The p_output_key
 *                                  buffer must be large enough to hold this value.
 * @param[in]      p_input_key      Pointer to buffer holding the input key material.
 * @param[in]      input_key_size   Length of the input key material.
 * @param[in]      p_salt           Pointer to buffer of nonsecret random salt data. Set to NULL in
 *                                  order to use the default salt defined by RFC 5869 (all zero
 *                                  array of hash digest size) or if salt is not used (expand only).
 * @param[in]      salt_size        Length of the salt. Must be > 0 unless default salt is used, or
 *                                  in case mode is set to @ref NRF_CRYPTO_HKDF_EXPAND_ONLY.
 * @param[in]      p_ainfo          Pointer to optional application specific information.
 *                                  (set to NULL and set ainfo_size to 0 if unused).
 * @param[in]      ainfo_size       Length of the additional information.
 * @param[in]      mode             Set to @ref NRF_CRYPTO_HKDF_EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND for normal mode.
 *                                  Alternatively, set to @ref NRF_CRYPTO_HKDF_EXPAND_ONLY to skip
 *                                  the extraction step.
 *
 * @retval  NRF_SUCCESS                     Output key material hash was successfully calculated.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_INPUT_NULL     If p_input_key was NULL.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_INPUT_LENGTH   If input_key_size or salt_size was invalid.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_OUTPUT_NULL    If p_output_key_sizen was NULL.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_OUTPUT_LENGTH  If *p_output_key_size is 0.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_ALLOC_FAILED   Unable to allocate memory for the context.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_INTERNAL       An error occurred in the crypto backend.
 * @retval  NRF_ERROR_CRYPTO_BUSY           The function could not be called because the
 *                                          nrf_crypto backend was busy. Please rerun the
