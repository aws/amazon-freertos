/**@brief Macro for creating a registration for an async handler for the SVCI interface
 *
 * @details     Calling this macro will register a SVCI function handler using @ref
 *              NRF_SVCI_FUNCTION_REGISTER
 *
 * @note This macro must be invoked from a source file as it declares static functions
 *       to be implemented and because it creates a @ref lib_section_vars registration to
 *       SVCI interface which is intended to be unique.
 *
 * @param[in]   svci_num    SVC indirect number.
 * @param[in]   name        Name of the async function.
 * @param[in]   param_type  Type of the param to send when running the async interface.
 * @param[in]   state_type  Type of the state to be called together with sys_event.
 *
 * @retval Static declarations to handler functions to be implemented in the form NAME_handler
 *         NAME_on_call, and NAME_on_sys_event.
