 * @brief Module for storing data on BLE connections.
 *
 * @details This module stores certain states for each connection, which can be queried by
 *          connection handle. The module uses BLE events to keep the states updated.
 *
 *          In addition to the preprogrammed states, this module can also keep track of a number of
 *          binary user states, or <i>user flags</i>. These are reset to 0 for new connections, but
 *          otherwise not touched by this module.
 *
 *          This module uses the @ref nrf_atomic module to make the flag operations thread-safe.
 *
 * @note A connection handle is not immediately invalidated when it is disconnected. Certain states,
 *       such as the role, can still be queried until the next time a new connection is established
 *       to any device.
