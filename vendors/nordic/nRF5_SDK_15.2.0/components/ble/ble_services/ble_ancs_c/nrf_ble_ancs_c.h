 *
 * @brief Apple Notification Center Service Client Module.
 *
 * @details Disclaimer: This client implementation of the Apple Notification Center Service can
 *          be changed at any time by Nordic Semiconductor ASA. Server implementations such as the
 *          ones found in iOS can be changed at any time by Apple and may cause this client
 *          implementation to stop working.
 *
 * This module implements the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) client.
 * This client can be used as a Notification Consumer (NC) that receives data
 * notifications from a Notification Provider (NP). The NP is typically an iOS
 * device acting as a server. For terminology and up-to-date specs, see
 * http://developer.apple.com.
 *
 * The term "notification" is used in two different meanings:
 * - An <i>iOS notification</i> is the data received from the Notification Provider.
 * - A <i>GATTC notification</i> is a way to transfer data with <i>Bluetooth</i> Smart.
 * In this module, we receive iOS notifications using GATTC notifications.
 * We use the full term (iOS notification or GATTC notification) where required to avoid confusion.
 *
 * Upon initializing the module, you must add the different iOS notification attributes you
 * would like to receive for iOS notifications (see @ref nrf_ble_ancs_c_attr_add).
 *
 * Once a connection is established with a central device, the module does a service discovery to
 * discover the ANCS server handles. If this succeeds (@ref BLE_ANCS_C_EVT_DISCOVERY_COMPLETE),
 * the handles for the ANCS server are part of the @ref ble_ancs_c_evt_t structure and must be
 * assigned to an ANCS_C instance using the @ref nrf_ble_ancs_c_handles_assign function. For more
 * information about service discovery, see the @ref lib_ble_db_discovery documentation.
 *
 * The application can now subscribe to iOS notifications using
 * @ref ble_ancs_c_notif_source_notif_enable. They arrive in the @ref BLE_ANCS_C_EVT_NOTIF event.
 * @ref nrf_ble_ancs_c_request_attrs can be used to request attributes for the notifications. They
 * arrive in the @ref BLE_ANCS_C_EVT_NOTIF_ATTRIBUTE event.
 * @ref nrf_ble_ancs_c_app_attr_request can be used to request attributes of the app that issued
 * the notifications. They arrive in the @ref BLE_ANCS_C_EVT_APP_ATTRIBUTE event.
 * @ref nrf_ancs_perform_notif_action can be used to make the Notification Provider perform an
 * action based on the provided notification.
