 * @brief Cycling Speed and Cadence Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Cycling Speed and Cadence Service. If enabled, notification
 *          of the Cycling Speead and Candence Measurement is performed when the application
 *          calls ble_cscs_measurement_send().
 *
 *          To use this service, you need to provide the the supported features (@ref BLE_CSCS_FEATURES).
 *          If you choose to support Wheel revolution data (feature bit @ref BLE_CSCS_FEATURE_WHEEL_REV_BIT),
 *          you then need to support the 'setting of cumulative value' operation by the supporting the
 *          Speed and Cadence Control Point (@ref ble_sdk_srv_sc_ctrlpt) by setting the @ref BLE_SRV_SC_CTRLPT_CUM_VAL_OP_SUPPORTED
 *          bit of the ctrplt_supported_functions in the @ref ble_cscs_init_t structure.
 *          If you want to support the 'start autocalibration' control point feature, you need, after the @ref BLE_SC_CTRLPT_EVT_START_CALIBRATION
 *          has been received and the auto calibration is finished, to call the @ref ble_sc_ctrlpt_rsp_send to indicate that the operation is finished
 *          and thus be able to receive new control point operations.
 *          If you want to support the 'sensor location' related operation, you need to provide a list of supported location in the
 *          @ref ble_cscs_init_t structure.
 *
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_cscs_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_CSCS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_cscs_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
