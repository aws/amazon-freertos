 * @details  This module contains the APIs and types exposed by the Running Speed and Cadence
 *           Service Client module. These APIs and types can be used by the application to perform
 *           discovery of Running Speed and Cadence Service at the peer and interact with it.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_rscs_c_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_RSCS_C_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_rscs_c_on_ble_evt, &instance);
