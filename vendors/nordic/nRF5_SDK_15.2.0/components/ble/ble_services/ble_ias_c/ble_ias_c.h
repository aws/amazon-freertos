 * @brief Immediate Alert Service Client module
 *
 * @details This module implements the Immediate Alert Service client - locator role of the Find Me
 *          profile. On @ref BLE_GAP_EVT_CONNECTED event, this module starts discovery of the
 *          Immediate Alert Service with Alert Level characteristic at the peer. This module will
 *          indicate the application about a successful service & characteristic discovery using
 *          @ref BLE_IAS_C_EVT_DISCOVERY_COMPLETE event. The application can use @ref
 *          ble_ias_c_send_alert_level function to signal alerts to the peer.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_ias_c_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_IAS_C_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_ias_c_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
