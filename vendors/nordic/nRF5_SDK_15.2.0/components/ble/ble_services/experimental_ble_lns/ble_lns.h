 * @brief   Location and Navigation Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Location and Navigation Service with the Location and Speed, Position
 *          Quality, Feature, Control Point, and Navigation characteristics.
 *
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Location and Navigation Service will
 *          generate Location and Navigation Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_lns_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_LNS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_lns_on_ble_evt, &instance);
