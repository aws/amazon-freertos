 * @brief Bond Management Service (BMS) module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Bond Management Service (BMS).
 *          By writing to the Bond Management Control Point, the connected peer can request the deletion of
 *          bond information from the device.
 *          If authorization is configured, the application must supply an event handler for receiving Bond
 *          Management Service events. Using this handler, the service requests authorization when
 *          a procedure is requested by writing to the Bond Management Control Point.
