 * @ingroup  ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief    Nordic UART Service implementation.
 *
 * @details The Nordic UART Service is a simple GATT-based service with TX and RX characteristics.
 *          Data received from the peer is passed to the application, and the data received
 *          from the application of this service is sent to the peer as Handle Value
 *          Notifications. This module demonstrates how to implement a custom GATT-based
 *          service and characteristics using the SoftDevice. The service
 *          is used by the application to send and receive ASCII text strings to and from the
 *          peer.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_nus_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_NUS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_nus_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
