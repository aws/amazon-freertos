 * @brief Link Loss Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Link Loss Service with the Alert Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the Link Loss Service and Alert Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          The application must supply an event handler for receiving Link Loss Service
 *          events. Using this handler, the service will notify the application when the
 *          link has been lost, and which Alert Level has been set.
 *
 *          The service also provides a function for letting the application poll the current
 *          value of the Alert Level characteristic.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_lls_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_LLS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_lls_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
