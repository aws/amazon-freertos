 * @ingroup  ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief    The LED Button Service client can be used to set a LED, and read a button state on a
 *           LED button service server.
 *
 * @details  This module contains the APIs and types exposed by the LED Button Service Client
 *           module. These APIs and types can be used by the application to perform discovery of
 *           LED Button Service at the peer and interact with it.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_lbs_c_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_LBS_C_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_lbs_c_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
