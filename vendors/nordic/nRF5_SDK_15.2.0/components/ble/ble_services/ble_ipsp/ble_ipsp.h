 * @brief Internet Protocol Support Profile.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Internet Protocol Support Profile creating and managing
 *          transport for 6lowpan.
 *          GATT is used to discover if IPSP is supported or not, but no IP data is exchanged
 *          over GATT. To exchange data, LE L2CAP Credit Mode is used. The PSM used for the channel
 *          is BLE_IPSP_PSM and is defined by the specification. The MTU mandated by the
 *          specification is 1280 bytes.
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA's Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
