 * @brief Blood Pressure Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Blood Pressure Service.
 *
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Blood Pressure
 *          Service will generate Blood Pressure Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_bps_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_BPS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_bps_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
