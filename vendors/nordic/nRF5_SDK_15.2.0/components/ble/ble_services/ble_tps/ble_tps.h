 * @details This module implements the TX Power Service with the TX Power Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the TX Power Service and TX Power Level characteristic
 *          with the specified initial value to the BLE stack database.
 *
 *          It provides a function for letting the application update the TX Power Level
