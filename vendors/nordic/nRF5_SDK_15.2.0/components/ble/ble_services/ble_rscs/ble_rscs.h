 * @brief Running Speed and Cadence Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Running Speed and Cadence Service. If enabled, notification
 *          of the Running Speead and Candence Measurement is performed when the application
 *          calls ble_rscs_measurement_send().
 *
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Running Speed and Cadence
 *          Service will generate Running Speed and Cadence Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_rscs_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_RSCS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_rscs_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
