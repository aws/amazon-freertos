 * @brief Battery Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Battery Service with the Battery Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the Battery Service and Battery Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack database. Optionally it can also add a Report Reference descriptor
 *          to the Battery Level characteristic (used when including the Battery Service in
 *          the HID service).
 *
 *          If specified, the module will support notification of the Battery Level characteristic
 *          through the ble_bas_battery_level_update() function.
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Battery Service will
 *          generate Battery Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_bas_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_BAS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_bas_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
