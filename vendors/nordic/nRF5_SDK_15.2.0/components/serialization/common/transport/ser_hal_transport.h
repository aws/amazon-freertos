 * @brief HAL Transport layer for serialization.
 *
 * @details The @ref ser_hal_transport declares functions and typedefs used as API of the HAL
 *          transport layer for serialization. This layer is fully hardware-independent.
 *          Currently, the HAL transport layer is responsible for controlling the PHY layer and
 *          memory management. In the future, more features might be added to it, such as CRC
 *          or retransmission.
