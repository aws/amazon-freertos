 *
 * @brief PHY layer for serialization.
 *
 * @details The @ref ser_phy library declares functions and definitions of data structures and
 *          identifiers (typedef enum) that are used as API of the serialization PHY layer.
 *
 * \par Rationale
 * Each specific PHY layer (SPI, I2C, UART, low power UART etc.) should provide the same API. This
 * allows the layer above (the HAL Transport layer), which is responsible for controlling the PHY
 * layer, memory management, CRC, retransmission etc., to be hardware independent.
 *
 *
 * \par Interlayer communication and control
 * The PHY layer is controlled by the HAL transport layer by calling functions declared in
 * the @ref ser_phy library.
 *
 * @par
 * The PHY layer communicates events to the HAL transport layer by calling a callback function.
 * A handler to this function is passed in the @ref ser_phy_open function. This callback function
 * should be called with a parameter of type @ref ser_phy_evt_t, filled accordingly to an event to be
 * passed. Types of supported events are defined in @ref ser_phy_evt_type_t.
 *
 * @par
 * For example, to pass an event indicating that an RX packet has been successfully received, first a
 * struct of type @ref ser_phy_evt_t must be filled:
 * @code
 * ser_phy_evt_t phy_evt;
 * phy_evt.evt_type = SER_PHY_EVT_RX_PKT_RECEIVED;
 * phy_evt.evt_params.rx_pkt_received.p_buffer = (pointer to the RX buffer);
 * phy_evt.evt_params.rx_pkt_received.num_of_bytes = (number of received bytes);
 * @endcode
 * Then, the callback function must be called:
 * @code
 * events_handler(phy_evt);
 * @endcode
 * All functions declared in the @ref ser_phy file (ser_phy.h) must be implemented. Some events specified in
 * @ref ser_phy_evt_type_t are optional to implement.
 *
 * \par Transmitting a packet
 * Each PHY layer is responsible for adding the PHY header to a packet to be sent. This header
 * consists of a 16-bit field that carries the packet length (the uint16_encode function defined in
 * app_util.h should be used to ensure endianness independence). A pointer to a packet to be sent
 * and length of the packet are parameters of the @ref ser_phy_tx_pkt_send function. When a packet
 * has been transmitted, an event of type @ref SER_PHY_EVT_TX_PKT_SENT should be emitted.
 *
 * \image html ser_phy_transport_tx.svg "TX - interlayer communication"
 *
 * \par Receiving a packet
 * The PHY layer should be able to store only the PHY header (16-bit field carrying the packet
 * length). After the PHY header has been received, the transmission is stopped and the PHY
 * layer must send a request to the HAL transport layer for memory to store the packet - an event
 * of type @ref SER_PHY_EVT_RX_BUF_REQUEST with event parameters defined in
 * @ref ser_phy_evt_rx_buf_request_params_t (the uint16_decode function defined in app_util.h should
 * be used for header decoding to ensure endianness independence). The transmission should be
 * resumed when the @ref ser_phy_rx_buf_set function has been called.
 *
 * @par
 * When the @ref ser_phy_rx_buf_set function parameter equals NULL, there is not
 * enough memory to store the packet. However, the packet will be received to a dummy location to
 * ensure continuous communication. After receiving has finished, an event of type
 * @ref SER_PHY_EVT_RX_PKT_DROPPED is generated.
 *
 * \image html ser_phy_transport_rx_dropped.svg "RX dropping - interlayer communication"
 *
 * @par
 * When the @ref ser_phy_rx_buf_set function parameter is different than NULL, the packet is
 * received to a buffer pointed to by it. After receiving has finished, an event of type
 * @ref SER_PHY_EVT_RX_PKT_RECEIVED is generated with event parameters defined in
 * @ref ser_phy_evt_rx_pkt_received_params_t.
 *
 * \image html ser_phy_transport_rx_received.svg "RX - interlayer communication"
 *
 * \par PHY layer errors
 * PHY layer errors can be signaled by an event of type @ref SER_PHY_EVT_RX_OVERFLOW_ERROR or
 * @ref SER_PHY_EVT_TX_OVERREAD_ERROR or @ref SER_PHY_EVT_HW_ERROR with event parameters defined in
 * @ref ser_phy_evt_hw_error_params_t.
 *
 * @par Available PHY layers
 * The following PHY layers are available:
 * - @ref ser_phy_spi_page
 * - @ref ser_phy_spi_5W_page
 * - @ref ser_phy_uart_page
 * - @ref ser_phy_uart_hci_page
 * <!-- - @ref ser_phy_usb_hci_page -->
