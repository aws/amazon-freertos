 * @details Because additional preparation may be required to be done by user modules,
 * prior to putting hardware into the sleep mode, a notification and approval mechanism
 * is provided to the user.
 * Each module that wants to be notified about the "falling asleep" event, has to subscribe
 * to the HAL_EVENT_FALLING_ASLEEP event, using sys_sleep_approver_register(), and to
 * get the unique approver's ID value.
 * In the handler of the HAL_EVENT_FALLING_ASLEEP event, the module is able to perform
 * the required preparation before falling asleep, and to approve the falling asleep request,
 * using the module unique approver ID, after all preparation to sleep is finished.
 * The hardware will fall asleep only after all the registered approvers
 * approve the fall asleep request.
