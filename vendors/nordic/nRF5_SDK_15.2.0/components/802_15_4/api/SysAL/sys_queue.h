 * @brief Module to declare the queue API.
 * @details The queue module implements a set of routines to deal with queues. Before
 * any calls to its API are issued, a queue must be initialized using sys_queue_init(). The following routines
 * return queue items from different parts of an initialized queue without removing it from the queue:
 * sys_queue_front(), sys_queue_back(), sys_queue_next(), and sys_queue_at().
 * The following routines insert elements to the queue: sys_queue_push_front(),
 * sys_queue_push_back(), sys_queue_push_predicated(), sys_queue_push_predicated_force(), and sys_queue_insert().
 * The following routines remove elements from the queue: sys_queue_pop_front(), sys_queue_remove(),
 * sys_queue_remove_after(). These helper routines get information about a queue: sys_queue_size() and
 * sys_queue_is_empty(). The module also supports an iterator macro implemented by SYS_QUEUE_FOR_EACH().
