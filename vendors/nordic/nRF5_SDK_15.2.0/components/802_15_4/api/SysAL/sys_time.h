 * @brief Module for declaring Time API.
 * @details The system time module implements some routines to deal with time (timers). The timer can be started by
 * sys_timer_start(), stopped by sys_timer_stop(), and adjusted after sleep by sys_timer_adjust(). Some
 * information can be acquired by sys_timer_is_started() and sys_time_get(). The correct API for implementing hardware
 * delays is sys_time_delay_us(). Note that the module must be initialized by sys_timers_init() which
 * is done by sys_init().
