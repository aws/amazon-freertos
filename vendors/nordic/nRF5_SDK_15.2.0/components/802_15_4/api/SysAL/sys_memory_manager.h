 * @brief Module to declare Memory Manager API.
 * @details The Memory Manager module implements the standard API for allocating/freeing memory chunks. The module must
 * be initialized by sys_mm_init() before a call to any alloc/free routines. The memory can be allocated by a
 * call to sys_mm_alloc() and freed by a call to sys_mm_free(). Minimal chunk of memory to allocate is one byte,
 * however the sys_mm_alloc() routine will allocate the number of bytes aligned to the length of the
 * machine word (e.g. 4 bytes for 32-bit architectures). The module is implemented using the doubly linked
 * lists API.
