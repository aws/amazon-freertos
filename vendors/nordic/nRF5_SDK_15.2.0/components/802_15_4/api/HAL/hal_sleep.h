 * @brief Module to declare HAL Sleep API
 * @details The Sleep module implements the only hal_sleep() routine to put the hardware to the sleep mode for some
 * milliseconds. The user can use convenient macros DAYS_TO_MS(), HOURS_TO_MS(), MINS_TO_MS(), and SEC_TO_MS()
 * to convert different time periods into milliseconds. Please note that this module requires a call to
 * hal_sleep_init() which is in turn called by sys_init() before using any module routines. This module is
 * only used to implement the System Sleep interface. The hal_sleep() routine is not assumed to be used by
 * the user explicitly.
