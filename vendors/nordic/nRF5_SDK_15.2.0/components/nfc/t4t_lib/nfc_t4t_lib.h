 * @brief The T4T emulation library interface
 *
 * This is the NFC Forum NDEF tag 4 type emulation library. It implements the ISO14443-4A protocol
 * (ISO-DEP) and additionally can emulate a read-writable NDEF content. If the emulation of the NDEF
 * content is not needed, the library works in a raw mode where all APDUs are delivered to the user,
 * who is then responsible to generate a timely RPDU as a response.
 *
 * The sequence of initializing functions determines whether the NDEF emulation will run or whether
 * the raw mode is used.
 *
 *   - E.g. NDEF emulation
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_setup
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_ndef_rwpayload_set or @ref nfc_t4t_ndef_staticpayload_set
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_emulation_start
 *        * ... running in NDEF emulation mode ...
 *   - E.g. RAW mode 
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_setup
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_emulation_start
 *        * ... running in RAW emulation mode ...
