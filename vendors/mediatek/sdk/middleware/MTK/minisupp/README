These programs are dual-licensed under both the GPL version 2 and BSD
license (the one with advertisement clause removed). Either license
may be used at your option.


This package may include either wpa_supplicant, hostapd, or both. See
README file respective subdirectories (wpa_supplicant/README or
hostapd/README) for more details.

Source code files were moved around in v0.6.x releases and compared to
earlier releases, the programs are now built by first going to a
subdirectory (wpa_supplicant or hostapd) and creating build
configuration (.config) and running 'make' there (for Linux/BSD/cygwin
builds).
