 *
 * - \b Introduction \n
 *   MediaTek LinkItâ„¢ SDK hardware abstraction layer (HAL) driver is embedded software ensuring maximized portability across IoT portfolio designed for MediaTek LinkIt for real-time OS (RTOS) development platform.\n
 *   The HAL driver includes:\n
 *   - Drivers for the peripheral modules, such as UART and I2C.\n
 *   - Drivers for the system modules, such as CACHE, MPU and FLASH.\n
 *   - APIs of the modules.\n
 *
 *   The HAL driver has both standard and advanced features and is easy to use. It makes the upper hardware abstraction layer portable.\n
 *   The HAL layer provides a generic set of APIs to interact with the upper layers, such as application, middleware and the OS. The APIs are defined interfaces for MediaTek IoT portfolio, so the upper layer written with the HAL API is portable across the MediaTek IoT platforms.\n
 *   The HAL driver covers rich modules, including all peripheral modules, such as UART, I2C and SPI. It also includes number of system modules, such as CACHE, MPU, FLASH and DMA.\n
 *   The HAL complies with the general naming convention and common coding style. Each module of the HAL has its distinctive folder structure along with supporting examples.
 * - \b HAL \b driver \b architecture \n
 * The HAL driver architecture is shown below:\n
 * @image html hal_overview_driver_architecture.png
 * - \b HAL \b folder \b structure \b and \b file \b inclusion \b model \n
 *  - \b HAL \b folder \b structure \n
 *    The HAL module folder structure is shown below:
 * @image html hal_overview_folder_structure.png
 *    - Driver: All common driver files, such as board driver, HAL driver and CMSIS.\n
 *    - Driver/board: The driver files that are associated with the board, such as CTP or LCM.\n
 *    - Driver/chip/inc: The public header files of the HAL.\n
 *    - Driver/chip/mtxxxx: The driver files that are specific to the chipset, such as UART, I2C, GPT, PWM, WDT, etc.\n
 *    - Driver/CMSIS: The files that are associated with the CMSIS-CORE.\n
 *
 *  - \b File \b inclusion \b model \n
 * @image html hal_overview_file_inclusion_model.png
 *
 * - \b HAL \b driver \b rules \n
 *  - \b HAL \b file  \b naming \b convention \n
 *       The HAL public header files are named as hal_{feature}.h, such as hal_adc.h.\n
 *       The HAL driver files are all in driver/chip/mtxxxx/inc and driver/chip/mtxxxx/src,
 *       they are named as hal_{feature}.c or hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}.c,
 *       such as hal_cache.c and hal_cache_internal.c.\n
 *  - \b HAL \b public \b API \b naming \b convention \n

 *       |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *       |function names         | hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}(), such as #hal_uart_init()
 *       |enum names             | Type name:hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}_t, such as #hal_uart_baudrate_t. \n Enum member names:HAL_{FEATURE}_{SUB_FEATURE}, such as #HAL_UART_BAUDRATE_110.
 *       |struct name            | Type name:hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}_t,such as #hal_uart_config_t.\n Struct member names must be lowercase.
 *       |macro names            | HAL_{FEATURE}_{SUB_FEATURE}, such as #HAL_NVIC_QUERY_EXCEPTION_NUMBER
 *       |function pointer names | hal_{feature}_{sub_feature}_t(), such as void (*#hal_uart_callback_t)().\n
 *
 * - \b HAL \b configuration \n
 *  - \b hal_feature_config.h \n
 *      Every project should include hal_feature_config.h for HAL configuration.\n
 *      If certain HAL modules are not used, they can be removed from the feature options by undefining the macro, such as undefine the option of HAL_ADC_MODULE_ENABLED.\n
 *     For customized parameter settings, such as on the LinkIt 2523, if MTK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_208M, MTK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_104M or MTK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_26M is defined, the system MCU frequency will be set to 208MHz, 104MHz or 26MHz at the bootup.\n
 *  - \b hal_feature_config_template.h \n
 *       This is a template file in driver/chip/mtxxxx/inc. It can be referred to when creating a new hal_feature_config.h.
 * \n
 * \n
 * @section HAL_Overview_3_Chapter    HAL Driver Model
 * Some of the drivers can operate in two modes: polling and interrupt.
 * The UART HAL driver, for example, can operate in polling and interrupt modes during data communication. The polling mode is suitable for read and write operations of small amount of data in low frequency. The interrupt mode is suitable for read and write operations of small amount of data in high frequency. In UART DMA mode, for example, an interrupt is triggered once the DMA is complete.
 * - \b Polling \b mode \b architecture \n
 *   Most of the driver modules support the polling mode, which is the basic feature in HAL.\n
 *   For example, call the #hal_gpt_delay_ms() API to apply a millisecond time delay in the GPT. The GPT HAL driver will poll the GPT hardware, if the time delay is reached.\n
 *   The polling mode driver architecture is shown below:
 *   @image html hal_overview_driver_polling_architecture.png
 *
 * - \b Interrupt \b mode \b architecture \n
 *   To improve the portability, the HAL driver hides the OS dependence by preventing the upper layer to call the OS level services directly. The HAL drivers uses an interrupt handler to provide the upper layer with a callback mechanism.
 *
 *   To use the interrupt handler of a driver module, a callback should be registered with the interrupt handler. When the interrupt occurs, the callback is invoked in Cortex-M4 handler mode.
 *   Call the #hal_uart_send_dma() API to send data in the UART interrupt mode (UART DMA mode). The UART HAL driver will copy the data to DMA buffer and start the DMA operation while the DMA sends data to the UART hardware. When the DMA operation completes, the DMA interrupt is issued. The UART HAL driver will invoke the user callback in interrupt handler to notify that the data has been sent out by the UART.
 *   Another example of the interrupt is the GPT interrupt mode. Call the #hal_gpt_start_timer_ms() API to start a timer. When the timer expires, the GPT hardware issues an interrupt. Then the GPT HAL driver will invoke the user callback in interrupt handler to notify that the timer has expired.
 *   The interrupt mode driver architecture is shown below:
 *   @image html hal_overview_interrupt_mode_architecture.png
 *
 *   All HAL APIs are thread-safe and available for ISR. Developers may call HAL APIs in any FreeRTOS task or in an ISR.\n
 *   However, some hardware have limited resources, and the corresponding APIs return "ERROR_BUSY" status when there is a resource conflict due to the re-entrance. Developers should always check the return values from HAL APIs.\n
 *   For example, I2C master supports only one user at a time, so #hal_i2c_master_init() returns #HAL_I2C_STATUS_ERROR_BUSY when another user is using I2C master.\n
