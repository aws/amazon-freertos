 * \par<b>Description</b><br>
 * Provides the status of hibernate domain register update, when the respective mirror registers are changed. \n\n
 * The hibernate domain is connected to the core domain via SPI serial communication. MIRRSTS is a status register 
 * representing the communication of changed value of a mirror register to its corresponding register in the 
 * hibernate domain. The bit fields of the register indicate
 * that a corresponding register of the hibernate domain is ready to accept a write or that the communication interface
 * is busy with executing the previous operation.\n
 * Note: There is no hibernate domain in XMC1x devices. This register is retained for legacy purpose.

 * \par<b>Description</b><br>
 * Assigns the event handler function to be executed on occurrence of the selected event.\n\n
 * If the input event is valid, the handler function will be assigned to a table to be executed
 * when the interrupt is generated and the event status is set in the event status register. By using this API,
 * polling for a particular event can be avoided. This way the CPU utilization will be optimized. Multiple SCU events
 * can generate a common interrupt. When the interrupt is generated, a common interrupt service routine is executed.
 * It checks for status flags of events which can generate the interrupt. The handler function will be executed if the 
 * event flag is set.
