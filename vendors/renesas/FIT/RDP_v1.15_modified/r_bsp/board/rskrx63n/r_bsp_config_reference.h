* History : DD.MM.YYYY Version Description           
*         : 13.03.2012 1.00    First Release         
*         : 26.06.2012 1.10    Added MCU product part number section. Added endian options for user app and user boot.
*                              Added OFS register macros. Added option for ROM Code Protect. Added callback function
*                              options for exception interrupts.
*         : 16.07.2012 1.20    Fixed bug with exception callback function names. Added BSP_CFG_BCLK_OUTPUT and 
*                              BSP_CFG_SDCLK_OUTPUT macro options.
*         : 09.08.2012 1.30    Added BSP_CFG_IO_LIB_ENABLE macro.
*         : 20.09.2012 1.40    Added BSP_CFG_USER_LOCKING_ENABLED and BSP_CFG_USER_LOCKING_TYPE macros.
*         : 19.11.2012 1.50    Updated code to use 'BSP_' and 'BSP_CFG_' prefix for macros.
*         : 17.01.2013 1.60    Moved BSP_CFG_IO_LIB_ENABLE macro since it is now used in conjunction with 
*                              BSP_CFG_HEAP_BYTES. Added comments for disabling heap above BSP_CFG_HEAP_BYTES. 
*                              Added BSP_CFG_PARAM_CHECKING_ENABLE macro for configuring global parameter checking.
*         : 06.05.2013 1.70    Removed BSP_CFG_USER_APP_ENDIAN & BSP_CFG_USER_BOOT_ENDIAN macros. Endian is now detected
*                              using compiler macros. Added BSP_CFG_MCU_VCC_MV macro for FIT modules that need to know 
*                              Vcc.
*         : 25.06.2013 1.80    Added BSP_CFG_USER_STACK_ENABLE macro to enable/disable use of user stack. Removed 
*                              macros defining exception callbacks, undefined interrupt callback, and bus error 
*                              callback. Callbacks are now handled through mcu_interrupts.c.
*         : 26.11.2013 1.90    Added BSP_CFG_BOARD_REVISION macro to differentiate between prototype and MP boards.
*         : 31.03.2014 2.00    Added the ability for the user to define two 'warm start' callback functions which when
*                              defined result in a callback from PowerON_Reset_PC() before and/or after initialization
*                              of the C runtime environment. Added r_bsp_config file version number, which must match
*                              the BSP version number or a compiler warning will result. Added ability to specify user
*                              defined functions for redirection of the stdio charget() and/or charput() functions.
*         : 09.12.2015 2.10    Change the division ratio of PCLKA.
*         : 15.05.2017 2.20    Added Character(s) of the following macro definition.
