FreeRTOS currently only includes a subset of the TI CC32XX
SimpleLink SDK.  This keeps the download small, and provides a nice
out of box experience, but is not recommended for actual application
development.

After initial evaluation, users are strongly encouraged to download
and use the full TI SDK, which includes the missing documentation,
examples, and libraries.  For compatibility reasons, please be sure to
use the same version of the TI SDK as is provided with Amazon
FreeRTOS.

The download for the 2.10.00.04 version of the SDK is here:
