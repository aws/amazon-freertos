>For the __fatsd__, __fatsdraw__ and __sdraw__ examples, modifications must be made
to the SD Card BoosterPack. See the section below for details.

### SD Card BoosterPack Modifications
![](./images/SD_Card.jpg "CC3220S LAUNCHXL")

Scratch out the following traces:
* 1 - `SJ3`
* 2 - `SJ1`
* 3 - `SJ4`
* 4 - `SJ2`

Solder shorts for the following:
* 5 - `J2.4`
* 6 - `J2.5`
* 7 - `J2.8`

### Display Sharp BoosterPack Modifications
![](./images/Sharp_Display.jpg "CC3220SF LAUNCHXL")

Jumper Wire the following on the back of the launchpad
* 1 - `P58(NC)` to `P58`
* 2 - `P59(NC)` to `P03`

## ADC Examples Pin Connections

>__Important:__ The inputs to the ADC are required to be well within 1.4V to avoid clipping, which will cause distortion.
The ADC inputs can be damaged if an input voltage higher than 1.8V is applied to these pin. The 1.8V hard limit must be considered from both the SW and HW points of view.
Always add a resistor divider/buffer to bring down the measurement signal voltage to within the ADC limits. See the [CC32xx ADC Appnote](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC32xx_ADC_Appnote)
for more details.

The __CC3220SF LAUNCHXL__ has a protective circuit to allow an input of 3.3VDC.
The `5V` should NOT be used for this may damage the ADC inputs. For testing, the following jumpers must be present:
`J5` = `OPAMP EN`, `J10` = `GND`, `J13` = `BRD`.

>__Note:__ There are duplicate pins P59 and P60 on the board. Choose the ones connected to the Booster Pack headers (the pins not connected to the Booster Pack headers have an asterisk next to them).

## Peripherals Used

The following list shows which CC3220SF peripherals are used by
driver and kernel applications. Driver examples control which peripherals (and which ports) are used.

* __TI-RTOS Kernel (SYS/BIOS).__ Uses the first general-purpose timer available and that timer's associated interrupts. Generally, this will be Timer\_A0. The TI-RTOS Kernel manages the interrupt controller statically without an interrupt dispatcher.
* __Drivers.__
    * __I<sup>2</sup>C:__ The I<sup>2</sup>C driver is configured to support various BoosterPacks.
    * __PWM:__ The PWM driver uses the onboard LEDs (P01 and P02). These pins are configured for the PWM driver. While these pins can also be used by the GPIO driver, your application's board file must ensure that the pins are not simultaneously used by the GPIO and PWM drivers.
    * __SD:__ The SD driver is used to communicate with a SD card.  `Board_SD0` is used to send data to-and-from the SD card.
    * __SDFatFS:__ The SDFatFS driver relies on a SD driver instance to communicate with a SD card; `Board_SDFatFS0` uses the `Board_SD0` driver instance.
    * __SPI:__ The SPI driver is configured for SPI communications.
    * __Timer:__ The Timer and PWM driver uses the timer peripheral.
    * __UART:__ The UART driver uses UART0, which is attached to the onboard emulator to facilitate serial communications.
    * __Watchdog:__ The Watchdog driver example uses the Watchdog Timer peripheral.
