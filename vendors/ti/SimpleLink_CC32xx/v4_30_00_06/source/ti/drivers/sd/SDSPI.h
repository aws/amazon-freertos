 *
 *  @brief      SD driver implementation built on the TI SPI driver.
 *
 *  The SDSPI header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SD.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/sd/SDSPI.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref SD.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
 *
 *  This SD driver implementation can be used to communicate with SD cards
 *  via a SPI peripheral.  This driver leverages the TI SPI driver to transfer
 *  data to/from the host processor to the SD card.  The SD card chip select
 *  is also handled by this driver via the TI GPIO driver.  Both the SPI
 *  driver instance & the GPIO pin (used as chip select) must be specified
 *  in the SDSPI hardware attributes.
 *
 *  Note: This driver requires that the 'defaultTxBufValue' field in the SPI
 *  driver hardware attributes be set to '0xFF'.
 *
 *  ## Data location & alignment #
 *
 *  This driver relies on the TI SPI driver to configure the SPI peripheral &
 *  perform data transfers.  This means that data to be transferred must comply
 *  with rules & restrictions set SPI driver (memory alignment & DMA
 *  accessibility requirements).  Refer to @ref SPI.h & the device specific
 *  SPI implementation header files for details.

 *  @brief  SDSPI Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The #SDSPI_HWAttrs configuration structure contains the index of the SPI
 *  peripheral to be used for data transfers & the index of the GPIO Pin which
 *  will act as chip select.  This driver uses this information to:
 *      - configure & open the SPI driver instance for data transfers
 *      - select the SD card (via chip select) when performing data transfers
 *
 *  @struct SDSPI_HWAttrs
 *  An example configuration structure could look as the following:
 *  @code
 *  const SDSPI_HWAttrs sdspiHWAttrs[1] = {
 *      {
 *          // SPI driver index
 *          .spiIndex = 0,
 *
 *          //  GPIO driver pin index
 *          .spiCsGpioIndex = 3
 *      }
 *  };
