 *
 *  @brief      SPI driver implementation for a CC32XX SPI controller using the
 *              micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  The SPI header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SPI.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/spi/SPICC32XXDMA.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref SPI.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
 *
 *  This SPI driver implementation is designed to operate on a CC32XX SPI
 *  controller using a micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  @warning This driver does not support queueing multiple SPI transactions.
 *
 *  ## Frame Formats #
 *  This SPI controller supports 4 phase & polarity formats. Refer to the device
 *  specific data sheets & technical reference manuals for specifics on each
 *  format.
 *
 *  ## SPI Chip Select #
 *  This SPI controller supports a hardware chip select pin. Refer to the
 *  device's user manual on how this hardware chip select pin behaves in regards
 *  to the SPI frame format.
 *
 *  <table>
 *  <tr>
 *  <th>Chip select type</th>
 *  <th>SPI_MASTER mode</th>
 *  <th>SPI_SLAVE mode</th>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Hardware chip select</td>
 *  <td>No action is needed by the application to select the peripheral.</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Software chip select</td>
 *  <td>The application is responsible to ensure that correct SPI slave is
 *      selected before performing a SPI_transfer().</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  ## SPI data frames #
 *  SPI data frames can be any size from 4-bits to 32-bits.  The SPI data
 *  frame size is set in #SPI_Params.dataSize passed to SPI_open.
 *  The SPICC32XXDMA driver implementation makes assumptions on the element
 *  size of the #SPI_Transaction txBuf and rxBuf arrays, based on the data
 *  frame size.  If the data frame size is less than or equal to 8 bits,
 *  txBuf and rxBuf are assumed to be arrays of 8-bit uint8_t elements.
 *  If the data frame size is greater than 8 bits, but less than or equal
 *  to 16 bits, txBuf and rxBuf are assumed to be arrays of 16-bit uint16_t
 *  elements.  Otherwise, txBuf and rxBuf are assumed to point to 32-bit
 *  uint32_t elements.
 *
 *  data frame size  | buffer element size |
 *  --------------   | ------------------- |
 *  4-8 bits         | uint8_t             |
 *  9-16 bits        | uint16_t            |
 *  17-32 bits       | uint32_t            |
 *
 *  Data buffers in transactions (rxBuf & txBuf) must be address aligned
 *  according to the data frame size.  For example, if data frame is 9-bit
 *  (driver assumes buffers are uint16_t) rxBuf & txBuf must be aligned
 *  on a 16-bit address boundary, if data frame is 20-bit (driver assumes
 *  buffers are uint32_t) rxBuf & txBuf must be aligned on a 32-bit address
 *  boundary.
 *
 *  ## DMA Interrupts #
 *  This driver is designed to operate with the micro DMA. The micro DMA
 *  generates an interrupt on the perpheral's interrupt vector. This
 *  implementation automatically installs a DMA aware hardware ISR to service
 *  the assigned micro DMA channels.
 *
 *  ## DMA and Queueing
 *  This driver utilizes DMA channels in ping pong mode (see device TRM) in
 *  order to overcome the 1024 item DMA channel limit. This means the driver
 *  can execute multi kilo-item transactions without pausing to reconfigure the
 *  DMA and causing gaps in transmission. In addition, the driver also allows
 *  the user to queue up transfers when opened in #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK by calling
 *  SPI_transfer() multiple times. Note that each transaction's
 *  #SPI_Transaction struct must still be persistent and unmodified until that
 *  transaction is complete.
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_spi_SPICC32XXDMA_example_queueing
 *  Below is an example of queueing three transactions
 *  @code
 *  // SPI already opened in callback mode
 *  SPI_Transaction t0, t1, t2;
 *
 *  t0.txBuf = txBuff0;
 *  t0.rxBuf = rxBuff0;
 *  t0.count = 2000;
 *
 *  t1.txBuf = txBuff1;
 *  t1.rxBuf = rxBuff1;
 *  t1.count = 1000;
 *
 *  t2.txBuf = txBuff2;
 *  t2.rxBuf = NULL;
 *  t2.count = 1000;
 *
 *  bool transferOk = false;
 *
 *  if (SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t0)) {
 *      if (SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t1)) {
 *              transferOk = SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t2);
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## DMA accessible memory #
 *  As this driver uses uDMA to transfer data/from data buffers, it is the
 *  responsibility of the application to ensure that these buffers reside in
 *  memory that is accessible by the DMA.
 *
 *  ## Scratch Buffers #
 *  A uint32_t scratch buffer is used to allow SPI_transfers where txBuf or
 *  rxBuf are NULL. Rather than requiring txBuf or rxBuf to have a dummy buffer
 *  of size of the transfer count, a single DMA accessible uint32_t scratch
 *  buffer is used. When rxBuf is NULL, the uDMA will transfer all the SPI data
 *  receives into the scratch buffer as a "bit-bucket". When txBuf is NULL, the
 *  scratch buffer is initialized to defaultTxBufValue so the uDMA will send
 *  some known value. Each SPI driver instance must have its own scratch buffer.
 *
 *  ## Polling SPI transfers #
 *  When used in blocking mode small SPI transfers are can be done by polling
 *  the peripheral & sending data frame-by-frame.  This will not block the task
 *  which requested the transfer, but instead immediately perform the transfer
 *  & return.  The minDmaTransferSize field in the hardware attributes is
 *  the threshold; if the transaction count is below the threshold a polling
 *  transfer is performed; otherwise a DMA transfer is done.  This is intended
 *  to reduce the overhead of setting up a DMA transfer to only send a few
 *  data frames.  Keep in mind that during polling transfers the current task
 *  is still being executed; there is no context switch to another task.

 *  @brief  SPICC32XXDMA Hardware attributes
 *
 *  These fields, with the exception of intPriority,
 *  are used by driverlib APIs and therefore must be populated by
 *  driverlib macro definitions. For CCWare these definitions are found in:
 *      - driverlib/prcm.h
 *      - driverlib/spi.h
 *      - driverlib/udma.h
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - inc/hw_ints.h
 *
 *  intPriority is the SPI peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
 *  underlying OS.  It is passed unmodified to the underlying OS's interrupt
 *  handler creation code, so you need to refer to the OS documentation
 *  for usage.  For example, for SYS/BIOS applications, refer to the
 *  ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi documentation for SYS/BIOS usage of
 *  interrupt priorities.  If the driver uses the ti.dpl interface
 *  instead of making OS calls directly, then the HwiP port handles the
 *  interrupt priority in an OS specific way.  In the case of the SYS/BIOS
 *  port, intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
