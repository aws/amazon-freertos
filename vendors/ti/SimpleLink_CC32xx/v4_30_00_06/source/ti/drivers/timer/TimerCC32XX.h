 *  @brief      Timer driver interface for CC32XX devices
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  This driver implements half and full width general purpose timers for the
 *  CC32XX device. For CC32XX devices, the system clock is 80 MHz and a 16-bit
 *  timer has an 8-bit prescaler. The desired period may not always be
 *  achieved due to hardware limitations, such as the aforementioned. The timer
 *  resolution is limited to 12.5ns due to the 80 MHz clock. A timer period no
 *  greater than 209,714us can be achieved when operating in 16-bit mode.
 *  Similarly, a period no greater than 53,687,090us can be achieved when
 *  operating in 32-bit mode. The same time constraints apply to the 16-bit
 *  timer when attempting to use a frequency less than 5 Hertz. For additional
 *  details, refer to the device's technical reference manual.
 *
 *  The timer always operates in count down mode. When using a half width timer,
 *  an 8-bit prescaler will be implemented by the driver if necessary. If the
 *  timer is operating in Timer_FREE_RUNNING, the timer will count down from the
 *  specified period to 0 before restarting.
 *
 *  When using a half width timer, Timer_getCount() will return the
 *  value of the counter in bits 15:0 and bits 23:16 will contain the
 *  current free-running value of the prescaler. Bits 31:24 are always 0.
 *  When using a full width timer, Timer_getCount() will return the
 *  the value of the 32-bit timer.
 *
 *  #Timer_ONESHOT_CALLBACK is non-blocking. After Timer_start() is called,
 *  the calling thread will continue execution. When the timer interrupt
 *  is triggered, the specified callback function will be called. The timer
 *  will not generate another interrupt unless Timer_start() is called again.
 *  Calling Timer_stop() or Timer_close() after Timer_start() but, before the
 *  timer interrupt, will prevent the specified callback from ever being
 *  invoked.
 *
 *  #Timer_ONESHOT_BLOCKING is a blocking call. A semaphore is used to block
 *  the calling thead's execution until the timer generates an interrupt. If
 *  Timer_stop() is called, the calling thread will become unblocked
 *  immediately. The behavior of the timer in this mode is similar to a sleep
 *  function.
 *
 *  #Timer_CONTINUOUS_CALLBACK is non-blocking. After Timer_start() is called,
 *  the calling thread will continue execution. When the timer interrupt is
 *  treiggered, the specified callback function will be called. The timer is
 *  automatically restarted and will continue to periodically generate
 *  interrupts until Timer_stop() is called.
 *
 *  #Timer_FREE_RUNNING is non-blocking. After Timer_start() is called,
 *  the calling thread will continue execution. The timer will not
 *  generate an interrupt in this mode. The timer will count down from the
 *  specified period until it reaches 0. The timer will automatically reload
 *  the period and start over. The timer will continue running until
 *  Timer_stop() is called.
 *
 *  # Resource Allocation #
 *  Each general purpose timer block contains two timers, Timer A and Timer B,
 *  that can be configured to operate independently; or concatenated to operate
 *  as one 32-bit timer. This behavior is managed through a set of resource
 *  allocation APIs. For example, the TimerCC32XX_allocateTimerResource API
 *  will allocate a timer for exclusive use. Any attempt to allocate this
 *  resource in the future will result in a false value being returned from the
 *  allocation API. To free a timer resource, the TimerCC32XX_freeTimerResource
 *  is used. The application is not responsible for calling these allocation
 * APIs directly.
