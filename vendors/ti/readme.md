# Using TI on Amazon FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS currently only includes a subset of the TI CC32XX
SimpleLink SDK.  This keeps the download small, and provides a nice
out of box experience, but is not recommended for actual application
development.

After initial evaluation, users are strongly encouraged to download
and use the full TI SDK, which includes the missing documentation,
examples, and libraries.  For compatibility reasons, please be sure to
use the same version of the TI SDK as is provided with Amazon
FreeRTOS.

For compatibility reasons, please be sure to use the TI SDK versions listed
below as they have been verified together with Amazon FreeRTOS:

** TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC32xx SDK v4.30.00.06: **
   https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC32XX-SDK/4.30.00.06

** TI SimpleLink CC13x2 and CC26x2 SDK v4.30.00.54: **
   https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC13X2-26X2-SDK/4.30.00.54

Depending on the development platform, users might also need to download the
standalone SysConfig tool if not part if the SDK or IDE download:

** TI System Configuration Tool (SysConfig) v1.6.0: **
   https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SYSCONFIG/1.6.0_1543

# Common-IO

Starting from TI SDK version 4.30.*, a subset of the Amazon FreeRTOS common-io
layer is supported for all SimpleLink device SDKs listed above. While most
of the provided common-io ports are device agnostic, some are device specific
and only available for a given device family.

Available common-io ports are found under "simplelink_common/ports/common-io/src"
where device agnostic versions are found in the "simplelink" folder.

# Generating AWS Test and Demo binaries

The AWS Test and Demo projects is setup to be able to generate ".bin" output in
addition to the object file normally generated by the linker.

Depending on the system paths and environmental variables, the program search
might fail during the CMake generation step (resulting in a warning). If the
search fail and a binary output is required, the user must either add the TI
Code Composer Studio (CCS) path to the system path or manually define it during
the CMake invocation. An example on how this could be defined for a windows
platform during the cmake call:

cmake ... -DTI_CCS_PATH=c:/ti/ccs1000/ccs

# Generating driver code

The driver code for the test and demo projects was generated from
[aws_demo|aws_test].syscfg files found in, for example
ti/boards/cc3220_launchpad/application_code/ti_code/aws_demos.syscfg.

The file can be modified, and used to generate new driver files with scripts
distributed with TI System Configuration Tool (SysConfig).

Note that the full TI SDK is required for this, not the subset that is in this
repository.

An example command:
`<sysconfig_install_location>/sysconfig_cli.sh --compiler "gcc" --product <simplelink_cc32xx_sdk_4_30_00_06_install_location>/.metadata/product.json --output <output_folder> aws_demos.syscfg`
