case if the Host has issued the Disconnect command and there was a parameter
error, or the command was not presently allowed, or a Connection_Handle

The meaning of the Encryption_Enabled parameter depends on whether the
Host has indicated support for Secure Connections in the Secure_Connections_Host_Support
parameter. When Secure_Connections_Host_Support is
'disabled' or the Connection_Handle refers to an LE link, the Controller shall
only use Encryption_Enabled values 0x00 (OFF) and 0x01 (ON).

The Manufacturer_Name event parameter indicates the manufacturer

fixed. This allows the software to determine what Bluetooth hardware is being
used and, if necessary, to work around various bugs in the hardware.

Informtation provided includes type of radio activity and absolute time in system ticks when a new radio acitivity is schedule, if any.

A command @ref aci_hal_set_radio_activity_mask is provided to enable radio activity events of user interests, by default no events are enabled.
User should take into account that enablinng radio events in application with intense radio activity could lead to a fairly high rate of events generated.
