     * |        |          |The Host Controller sets this bit to a one when any port for which the Port Owner bit is set to zero has a change bit transition from a zero to a one or a Force Port Resume bit transition from a zero to a one as a result of a J-K transition detected on a suspended port
     * |        |          |This bit will also be set as a result of the Connect Status Change being set to a one after system software has relinquished ownership of a connected port by writing a one to a port's Port Owner bit.

     * |        |          |Ports can be disabled by either a fault condition (disconnect event or other fault condition) or by host software
     * |        |          |Note that the bit status does not change until the port state actually changes

     * |        |          |This functionality defined for manipulating this bit depends on the value of the Suspend bit
     * |        |          |For example, if the port is not suspended (Suspend and Enabled bits are a one) and software transitions this bit to a one, then the effects on the bus are undefined.
     * |        |          |Software sets this bit to a 1 to drive resume signaling
     * |        |          |The Host Controller sets this bit to a 1 if a J-to-K transition is detected while the port is in the Suspend state
     * |        |          |When this bit transitions to a one because a J-to-K transition is detected, the Port Change Detect bit in the USBSTS register is also set to a one
     * |        |          |If software sets this bit to a one, the host controller must not set the Port Change Detect bit.
     * |        |          |Note that when the EHCI controller owns the port, the resume sequence follows the defined sequence documented in the USB Specification Revision 2.0
     * |        |          |The resume signaling (Full-speed 'K') is driven on the port as long as this bit remains a one
     * |        |          |Software must appropriately time the Resume and set this bit to a zero when the appropriate amount of time has elapsed
     * |        |          |Writing a zero (from one) causes the port to return to high-speed mode (forcing the bus below the port into a high-speed idle)
     * |        |          |This bit will remain a one until the port has switched to the high-speed idle
     * |        |          |The host controller must complete this transition within 2 milliseconds of software setting this bit to a zero.
     * |        |          |This field is zero if Port Power is zero.

     * |        |          |Port Enabled Bit and Suspend bit of this register define the port states as follows:
     * |        |          |Port enable is 0 and suspend is 0 = Disable.
     * |        |          |Port enable is 0 and suspend is 1 = Disable.
     * |        |          |Port enable is 1 and suspend is 0 = Enable.
     * |        |          |Port enable is 1 and suspend is 1 = Suspend.
     * |        |          |When in suspend state, downstream propagation of data is blocked on this port, except for port reset
     * |        |          |The blocking occurs at the end of the current transaction, if a transaction was in progress when this bit was written to 1
     * |        |          |In the suspend state, the port is sensitive to resume detection
     * |        |          |Note that the bit status does not change until the port is suspended and that there may be a delay in suspending a port if there is a transaction currently in progress on the USB.
     * |        |          |A write of zero to this bit is ignored by the host controller
     * |        |          |The host controller will unconditionally set this bit to a zero when:
     * |        |          |Software sets the Force Port Resume bit to a zero (from a one).
     * |        |          |Software sets the Port Reset bit to a one (from a zero).
     * |        |          |If host software sets this bit to a one when the port is not enabled (i.e.
     * |        |          |Port enabled bit is a zero) the results are undefined.
     * |        |          |This field is zero if Port Power is zero.

     * |[8]     |PRST      |Port Reset (R/W)
     * |        |          |When software writes a one to this bit (from a zero), the bus reset sequence as defined in the USB Specification Revision 2.0 is started
     * |        |          |Software writes a zero to this bit to terminate the bus reset sequence
     * |        |          |Software must keep this bit at a one long enough to ensure the reset sequence, as specified in the USB Specification Revision 2.0, completes
     * |        |          |Note: when software writes this bit to a one, it must also write a zero to the Port Enable bit.
     * |        |          |Note that when software writes a zero to this bit there may be a delay before the bit status changes to a zero
     * |        |          |The bit status will not read as a zero until after the reset has completed
     * |        |          |If the port is in high-speed mode after reset is complete, the host controller will automatically enable this port (e.g.
     * |        |          |set the Port Enable bit to a one)
     * |        |          |A host controller must terminate the reset and stabilize the state of the port within 2 milliseconds of software transitioning this bit from a one to a zero
     * |        |          |For example: if the port detects that the attached device is high-speed during reset, then the host controller must have the port in the enabled state within 2ms of software writing this bit to a zero.
     * |        |          |The HCHalted bit in the USBSTS register should be a zero before software attempts to use this bit
     * |        |          |The host controller may hold Port Reset asserted to a one when the HCHalted bit is a one.
