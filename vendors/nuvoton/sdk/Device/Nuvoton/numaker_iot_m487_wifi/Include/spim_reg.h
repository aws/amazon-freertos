     * |        |          |For example, manufacturer id and device id of external SPI flash for some vendor are 0xEF and 0x1234 separately
     * |        |          |Firstly, we set RDDLYSEL to 0x0, and use read manufacturer id/device id command to read the manufacturer id of external SPI flash by using normal I/O mode (the manufacturer id is 0xEF (1110_1111) in this example).
     * |        |          |If manufacturer id which reads from external SPI flash is 0xF7 (1111_0111), it denotes that manufacturer id is shifted the right by 1 bit and most significant bit (MSB) of manufacturer id is assigned to 1
     * |        |          |According to manufacturer id reads from external SPI flash, we need to set RDDLYSEL to 0x1 to receive SPI flash data correctly.
