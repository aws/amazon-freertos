/** @file healthmon.h
*
*  @brief Health Monitor
*
*  Health monitor is a system process that monitors the health of the device
*  using. It queries the system services and applications periodically for their
*  health status. It uses the hardware watchdog (or approximate software
*  simulation, if hardware watchdog is not available) to recover if it detects
*  any problems.
*
*  \section healthmon_usage Usage
*
*  If application wishes to install its own periodic health check function, it
*  needs to instantiate \ref healthmon_handler structure that contains a valid
*  is_sick function. This function will be called by healthmon thread
*  periodically as specified by the handler. The function must return 0 in case
*  of healthy state and non-zero value in case of failure. The healthmon thread
*  obeys consecutive failures registered in handler before declaring system as
*  unhealthy. The \a about_to_die function is optional and gets called when
*  system is found unhealthy and is about to reboot.  In case of catastrophic
*  events, even though healthmon thread is unable to run (e.g. hardfault, frozen
*  system) the system reboots because the hardware watchdog is not strobed.
*
