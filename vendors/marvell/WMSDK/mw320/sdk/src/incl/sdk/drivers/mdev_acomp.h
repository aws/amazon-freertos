/** @file mdev_acomp.h
 *
 *  @brief This file contains Analog Comparator Driver
 *
 * ACOMP driver provides mdev interface to use 2 analog comparators.
 * Follow the steps below to use ACOMP driver from applications
 *
 * 1. Include Files
 *
 * Include mdev.h and mdev_acomp.h in your source file.
 *
 * 2. ACOMP driver initialization
 *
 * Call \ref acomp_drv_init from your application initialization function.
 * This will initialize and register acomp driver with the mdev interface.
 *
 * 3. Open ACOMP device to use
 *
 * \ref acomp_drv_open should be called once before using ACOMP hardware.
 * Here you will specify ACOMP number (from 0 to 1). The other parameters
 * that are set by default are -<br>
 * ACOMP_HYSTER_0MV - Hysteresis 0mV for positive input<br>
 * ACOMP_HYSTER_0MV - Hysteresis 0mV for negative input<br>
 * LOGIC_LO         - Output LOW during inactive state<br>
 * ACOMP_PWMODE_1   - BIAS Current (Response time)<br>
 * ACOMP_WARMTIME_16CLK - Warm-up time 16 clock cycles<br>
 * ACOMP_PIN_OUT_SYN - Synchronous pin output<br>
 *
 * If these defaults need to be changed they should be changed in
 * \ref acomp_drv_open
 *
 * \code
 * {
 *	mdev_t *acomp_dev;
 *	acomp_dev = acomp_drv_open(MDEV_ACOMP<0-1>);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * 4. Get result/output of ACOMP
 *
 * Call \ref acomp_drv_result to get the output of the mentioned
 * comparator.
 *
 * 5. Closing a device.
 *
 * A call to \ref acomp_drv_close informs the ACOMP driver to release the
 * resources that it is holding.
 *
 *
