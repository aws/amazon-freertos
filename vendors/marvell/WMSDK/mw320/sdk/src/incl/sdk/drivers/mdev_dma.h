 *
 *  @brief This file contains DMA Module
 *
 * mdev_dma is a module that handles DMA driver functionality a layer
 * above the low-level driver code. It establishes a mechanism to deploy
 * DMA capabilities to all peripherals, possibly simultaneously.
 *
 * The DMAC hardware supports 32 DMA channels. By default, four channels
 * can operate simultaneously. User may configure the value of NUM_DMA_CHANNELS
 * to modify the number of supported channels.
 *
 * This module provides a set of APIs to use DMA.
 * DMA transfer can be used for the following modes.
 * 1. MEMORY_TO_PERIPHERAL
 * 2. PERIPHERAL_TO_MEMORY
 * 3. MEMORY_TO_MEMORT
 * @note PERIPHERAL_TO_PERIPHERAL transfer is not supported.
 *
 * @note DMA driver limitations
 * 1. DMAC supports a maximum of 8191 byte data transfer with
 * the added restriction that SOURCE and DESTINATION
 * ADDRESSES should align with the transfer width.
 *
 * 2. DMA transfers will be asynchronous.
 *
 *
 *  A typical DMA usage scenario is as follows:
 *
 *  -# Initialize the DMA driver with a call dma_drv_init()
 *  -# Open a channel for DMA transfer using dma_drv_open()
 *  -# User needs to configure dma_config_type.
 *  -# [Optional] Call \ref dma_drv_set_cb to set callback for a specific
 *	dma channel.
 *  -# Call dma_drv_transfer \ref dma_drv_transfer with appropriate parameters.
 *  -# Close the DMM channel, on transfer complete.
 *  -# de-initialize DMA driver provided no code is using DMA.
 *
 * Code snippet:
 * Following code demonstrates how to use DMA driver API
 * to generate and handle an interrupt
 * @code
 * static void dma_cb(DMA_Channel_Type channel, void *data)
 * {
 *	process_dma_interrupt();
 * }
 *
 * {
 *	int err = dma_drv_init();
 *	if (err != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		err_handling();
 *
 *	mdev_t *dma_dev = dma_drv_open();
 *	if (dma_dev == NULL)
 *		err_handling();
 *
 * [optional] dma_drv_set_cb(dma_dev, dma_cb);
 *
 *	err = dma_drv_transfer(dma_dev, &dma_c);
 *	if (err != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		err_handling();
 *
 *	dma_drv_wait_for_transfer_complete();
 * }
 * @endcode
