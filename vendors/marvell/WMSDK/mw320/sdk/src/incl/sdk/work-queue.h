 * \brief Work Queue
 *
 * Work queues are software entities provided as a service to the
 * application layer to simplify the task of programming new
 * features. Whenever simple to moderate tasks are do be done in thread
 * context either once or periodically, work queues are a good
 * solution. They free up the application code for the tasks of creating
 * new thread and managing synchronization. In many use-cases, the new
 * application thread will be active for small portion of the time slice
 * and be idle otherwise. However, it still blocks up valuable RAM and
 * other system resources. Work queue can help here by sharing the thread
 * context including its stack among many jobs.
 *
 * The basic concept is to have a queue of jobs. This queue elements
 * i.e. jobs are executed one after another by a single thread. Additional
 * feature provided by work-queue is to have the options of automatically
 * running a job periodically. This feature is of immense benefit
 * w.r.t. optimum use of resources. One example will prove the
 * point. Consider the task is to blink an LED periodically every 500
 * mS. Without work-queue you will have two options. First, you create a
 * new thread and toggle the GPIO every 500 mS. The thread sleeps in between
 * for 500 mS. Second, you add a timer to call you back every 500 mS and
 * you toggle the LED in this callback. The first option works but for the
 * trivial task of changing the state of a GPIO, a separate thread is
 * present while sleeps for most of the time. Thus, the resources like
 * stack memory blocked by the thread are used inefficiently. The second
 * option will blink the LED well but may be harmful for other timer
 * objects. A timer thread runs has very high priority and the LED toggle
 * logic which involves access to the slow speed GPIO peripheral, starves
 * off other critical threads from access to CPU.
 *
 * A work queue can help here by doing this task of toggling the GPIO in a
 * normal priority thread (if so configured), periodically. The 500 mS
 * periodic execution is also handled automatically.

 * alive till the queue is de-init'ed. It sleeps when no jobs are present.
 *
 * A job is basically just a function (and its callees) with execute in the
 * worker thread context. Being a thread context a job can use mutexes,
 * semaphores and all remaining activities that a normal thread can do. The
 * only thing to keep in mind while designing jobs is to be aware that
 * other jobs also run in the same context and they will be starved of the
 * CPU if a job hogs the CPU or sleeps for a long time.

 * NULL is passed default values are used. The default values are
 * \ref DEFAULT_WORKER_PRIO and \ref DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE.
