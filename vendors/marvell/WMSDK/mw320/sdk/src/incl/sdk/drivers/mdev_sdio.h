 * \brief SDIO Driver
 *
 *  The SDIO driver is used to configure and do
 *  data transfer over the SDIO interface
 *
 * \section mdev_sdio_usage Usage
 *
 *  Steps to use sdio with mdev:
 *
 *  1. Register gpio using \ref sdio_drv_init()
 *
 *  2. Open the device using sdio_drv_open() call.
 *     This will return a handler to gpio.
 *
 *  3. To do various SDIO related operations:
 *
 *	- sdio_drv_write() : Write using CMD53
 *	- sdio_drv_read() : Read using CMD53
 *	- sdio_drv_creg_write() : Write using CMD52
 *	- sdio_drv_creg_read() : Read using CMD52
 *
 *     Locking mechanism is implemented to provide atomic access.
 *
 *  4. Close the device using sdio_drv_close() call.
