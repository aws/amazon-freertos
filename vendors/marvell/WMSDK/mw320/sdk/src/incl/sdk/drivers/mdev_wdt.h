 *  \brief WatchDog Timer (WDT) driver
 *
 * A watchdog timer is a piece of hardware that can be used to automatically
 * detect software anomalies and reset the processor if any occur.
 * The watchdog timer regains control in case of system failure (due to a
 * software error) to increase application reliability. The WDT can generate a
 * reset or an interrupt when the counter reaches a given timeout value.
 * WDT driver provides interface to the watchdog hardware.
 *
 * \section wdt_usage Usage
 *
 * A typical WDT device usage scenario is as follows:
 *
 * -# Initialize the watchdog timer driver using wdt_drv_init().
 * -# Open the WDT device handle for use using wdt_drv_open() call.
 * -# Call wdt_drv_set_timeout() in order to set timeout index value. It should
 *    be a 4 bit value between 0 - 15.
 * -# Call wdt_drv_start() to start the WatchDog timer.
 * -# To strobe/restart WDT device call wdt_drv_strobe().
 *
 *  Code snippet:\n
 *  Following code demonstrates how to configure WDT for timeout of 90 seconds.
 *  \code
 *  {
 *	int ret;
 *	mdev_t *wdt_dev;
 *	ret = wdt_drv_init();
 *	if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return;
 *	wdt_dev = wdt_drv_open("MDEV_WDT");
 *	if (wdt_dev == NULL)
 *		return;
 *	ret = wdt_drv_set_timeout(wdt_dev,0xF);
 *	if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return;
 *	wdt_drv_start(wdt_dev);
 *  }
 * \endcode
