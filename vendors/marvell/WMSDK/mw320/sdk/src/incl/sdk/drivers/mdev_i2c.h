 *
 *  @brief This file contains Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Driver (TWSI)

 * The 2-Wire Serial Interface (TSWI) unit is an interface between a
 * 2-wire serial bus and the CPU.
 * I2C Driver is meant to use TWSI hardware to communicate with
 * external peripheral connected on I2C bus through application.
 *
 *  a. The speed of operation:
 *	There are standard two speeds at which I2C peripherals operate.
 *	100KHz (Standard speed) and 400KHz (High speed).
 *	We have also provided 10KHz (Low speed) to handle any special case.
 *
 * b. Slave address definition:
 * 	Any valid transaction on I2C bus is associated with the device slave
 * 	address and each I2C peripheral has it's own address.
 * 	The I2C driver should be informed of the slave address of the peripheral
 *      that should be accessed.
 *
 * c. Interface type:
 * 	Internally TWSI can be connected to different hardware blocks.
 * 	This identifies the device connection and specifies the interface
 * 	type.
 *
 * Note: The FIFO size of the hardware FIFO is 16 bytes
 *
 * \section I2C_usage Usage
 *
 * Follow the steps below to use I2C driver from applications
 *
 * -# I2C driver initialization using \ref i2c_drv_init().
 * -# Open I2C device to handle using \ref i2c_drv_open() call.
 * -# Use i2c_drv_write or i2c_drv_read() calls to write or read data over
 *  I2C bus respectively.
 * -# Close the I2C port using i2c_drv_close() to release the resources that
 *  the driver holds.
 *
 * Typical example:
 *
 * Below peice of code demonstrates how to configure a I2C device whose slave
 * address is I2C_ADDR interfaced on I2C1 for read/write operation.
 * \code
 * {
 * 	mdev_t *i2c_dev;
 *
 *	i2c_dev = i2c_drv_open(I2C1_PORT,
 *			I2C_SLAVEADR(I2C_ADDR >> 1));
 *
 *  if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return;
 *
 *   uint8_t read_buf[4];
 *   uint8_t write_buf[2];
 *   buf[0] = 0x01;
 *   buf[1] = 0x02;
 *	 int read_len = i2c_drv_read(i2c_dev, buf, 4);
 *   int write_len = i2c_drv_write(i2c_dev, buf, 4);
 *	 i2c_drv_close(i2c_dev);
 * }
 *\endcode
 *
 * \note I2C_LCD_ADDR being a 8 bit address, was right shifted by 1 to make it
 * valid 7 bit I2C address. This is slave dependant operation, please check
 * slave device datasheet for more details.
 *
 * I2C master start stop generation: The I2C IP automatically handles
 * START and STOP condition generation. When first byte is put in TxFIFO
 * (using the API i2c_drv_write()), a START condition is generated and
 * slave address is automatically sent on the bus. When all bytes from the
 * TxFIFO are out on the bus the IP generates STOP condition on the
 * bus. This point is important to note while designing the I2C
 * application. For instance, the application may want to call
 * i2c_drv_write() multiple times during a single transaction. If the time
 * gap between any successive call exceeds FIFO emptying time then a STOP
 * will be generated automatically and things will not work as
 * expected. A potential pitfall is adding debugging prints in between two
 * calls to i2c_drv_write() which may delay next write and the FIFO will
 * may get emptied generating the unexpected STOP.
 * After all the writes are complete you may call
 * i2c_drv_wait_till_inactivity() to ensure that all the writes are out on
 * the bus an a STOP condition is generated signifying end of current
 * transaction.
 *
 * Conversely, if the application wishes to have two back to back
 * calls to i2c_drv_write() in separate transactions it needs to ensure
 * that TxFIFO is empty before second call to i2c_drv_write(). The API
 * i2c_drv_wait_till_inactivity() is provided for this purpose. Using this
 * API will ensure the application can after this API returns with a
 * success the earlier write is out on the bus and a STOP is generated. The
 * following example illustrates the scenario:
 *
 * 1. Write a byte to I2C device at an address
 *    - Write slave address
 *    - Write destination address
 *    - Write data to be written
 * 2. Use i2c_drv_wait_till_inactivity() to ensure this transaction is
 * complete.
 * 3. Read a byte from some other address
 *   - Write slave address
 *   - Write read address
 *   - Read data
 *
 * Note that the API i2c_drv_wait_till_inactivity() is not technically
 * necessary for STOP to be generated. It only helps the application to
 * sync itself with that particular bus event.
