/** @file mdev_ssp.h
 *
 *  @brief This file contains Synchronous Serial Protocol (SSP) Driver
 *
 * The SSP port is a synchronous serial controller that can be connected to
 * a variety of external devices which use serial protocol for data transfer.
 * There are 3 SSP interfaces viz, SSP0 , SSP1, SSP2. The SSP ports can
 * be configured to operate in Master Mode (wherein attached device is slave)
 * or Slave Mode (wherein external device is master).
 * SSP driver exposes various SSP device features through mdev interface.
 *
 * @section mdev_ssp_usage Usage
 *
 * -# Verify that board file API board_ssp_pin_config() located at
 *  sdk/src/boards/{board_file}.c reflects the correct pinmux settings.
 *  If found missing, please add the appropriate pinmux configuration
 *  corresponding to the SSP_ID_Type.

 * -# Initialize the SSP driver using ssp_drv_init().
 * -# Open the SSP device handle using ssp_drv_open().
 *    ssp_drv_open() takes as input  frame format (SPI or I2S)
 *    and master/slave mode. Optionally it can also accept custom
 *    chip select gpio pin for slave device.
 * -# Use ssp_drv_read() or ssp_drv_write() to read SSP data or
 * -# ssp_drv_set_clk() can be used to set frequency of SSP port.
 * -# ssp_drv_rxbuf_size() can be called to set Receive buffer size.
 *    to write data to SSP respectively.
 * -# Close the SSP device using ssp_drv_close() after its use.
 *    ssp_drv_close() call informs the SSP driver to release the resources that
 *    it is holding. It is always good practice to free the resources after use.
 *
 *  Code snippet:\n
 *  Following code demonstrates SSP0 in master mode
 *  transmitting & reading data back from a slave device.
 *
 *  @code
 *  {
 *	int ret;
 *	uint8_t buf[512];

 *                             SSP_MASTER, DMA_DISABLE,
 *                             -1, 0);
 *      unit32_t len = ssp_drv_write(ssp_dev, write_data,
 *                                    NULL,
