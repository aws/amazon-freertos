 * \brief System Work Queue
 *
 * Work queues are software entities provided as a service to the
 * application layer to simplify the task of programming new
 * features. For more information on this, please refer \ref work-queue.h.
 * If various modules need to use this feature, there will be too many work
 * queues in the system, which is not desirable. Hence, a common system queue
 * has been defined which can be used by all the modules. It runs at a priority
 * \ref DEFAULT_WORKER_PRIO and offers stack as per CONFIG_SYS_WQ_STACK config
 * option
