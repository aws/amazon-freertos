/**
 * Initialized System PSM
 *
 * This API is given as a helper function to initialize the PSM generally
 * used by app framework and applications. Though not mandatory the System
 * PSM is generally present in any decent application based on WMSDK. It
 * stores key-value pairs viz. AP SSiD, Passphrase required for wlan
 * functionality. The application may also use this PSM to store its own
 * key-value data.
 *
 * The System PSM partition is just like any other psm-v2 partition. So,
 * once initialized using this API, the sys_psm_get_handle() should be used
 * to retrieve the System PSM handle. This handle should then be used along
 * with PSMv2 APIs present in psm-v2.h
 *
 * @return WM_SUCCESS if System PSM is init'ed successfully.
 * @return Negative error code otherwise.

 * module with the enhancement that partition details can be specified either
 * as a partition name from partition table or as flash descriptor itself.
 * Refer to \ref psm_module_init_ex for more details.
 *
 * \note This API is useful for devices that do not have a standard system
 * PSM partition (with component type 'FC_COMP_PSM') in their partition table.
 *
 * @param[in] sys_init_part Pointer to \ref psm_init_part_t structure having
 * partition details. PSMv2 won't need the user copy of any field in
 * sys_init_part after call returns.

 * @return WM_SUCCESS if System PSM is init'ed successfully.
 * @return -WM_E_INVAL Invalid arguments.
 * @return -WM_E_NOMEM Memory allocation failure.
 * @return -WM_FAIL otherwise

 * for this purpose. psm cli commands take optional part-name
 * parameter. The part-name passed through this API is to be used at the
 * time to access the partition.
 *
 * @param[in] hnd This is the PSM handle. This can be obtained by called
 * psm_module_init() from the psm-v2 API set. Alternatively for System PSM
 * a helper function sys_psm_init() is also present.
 * @param[in] part_name This is the user friendly name of the PSM partition
 * to be used along with psm cli commands. This is the only purpose and
 * scope of the part_name.

 * @return WM_SUCCESS if cli registration was successful.
