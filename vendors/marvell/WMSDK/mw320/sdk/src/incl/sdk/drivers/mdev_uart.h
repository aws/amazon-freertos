 *
 *  @brief This file contains UART driver
 *
 * UART is a piece of hardware that translates data between parallel and serial
 * forms. It provides serial interface for communication to external world.
 * UART driver provides interface to use all available UARTs.
 *
 * \section uart_usage Usage
 *
 * A typical UART device usage scenario is as follows:
 *
 * -# Verify that board file API board_uart_pin_config() located at
 *  sdk/src/boards/{board_file}.c reflects the correct pinmux settings.
 *  If found missing, please add the appropriate pinmux configuration
 *  corresponding to the UART_ID.
 *  * -# Initialize the UART driver using uart_drv_init().
 * -# Open the UART device handle using uart_drv_open() call.
 * -# Use uart_drv_read() or uart_drv_write() calls to read UART data or
 *  to write data to UART respectively.
 * -# Close the UART device using uart_drv_close() after its use.
 *  uart_drv_close() call informs the UART driver to release the resources that
 *  it is holding. It is always good practice to free the resources after use.
 * -# Deinitialize the UART driver using uart_drv_deinit().
 *
 *  Code snippet:\n
 *  Following code demonstrates basic read operation over UART0
 *  UART0 is configured as 8 bits per character & baud-rate of 115200.
 *  \code
 *  {
 *	int ret;
 *	uint8_t buf[512];
 *	mdev_t *uart_dev;
 *	ret = uart_drv_init(UART0_ID, UART_8BIT);
 *	if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return;
 *	uart_dev = uart_drv_open(UART0_ID, 115200);
 *	if (uart_dev == NULL)
 *		return;
 *	len = uart_drv_read(uart_dev, buf, sizeof(buf));
 *	ret = uart_drv_close(uart_dev);
 *	if (ret != WM_SUCCESS)
 *		return;
 *	uart_drv_deinit(UART0_ID);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note\n
 * 1. Specify standard baud rates such as 9600,115200..
 * 2. When baudrate is 0 in uart_drv_open() call, UART driver will take
 * default baudrate as 115200.
 * 3. UART_ID_Type enumeration has values UART0_ID, UART1_ID, UART2_ID and
 * UART3_ID, each of which represents individual UART device.
 * 4. External buffer protection is needed in uart_drv_write().
 * 5. The caller must provide the read buffer in uart_drv_read().
