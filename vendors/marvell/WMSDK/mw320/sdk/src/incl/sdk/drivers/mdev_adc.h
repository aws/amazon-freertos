/** @file mdev_adc.h
 *
 *  @brief This file contains Analog to Digital Converter Driver
 *
 * ADC driver provides mdev interface to use the internal Analog to
 * Digital Converter unit/s.
 * Follow the steps below to use ADC driver from applications
 *
 * 1. Include Files
 *
 * Include mdev.h and mdev_adc.h in your source file.
 *
 * 2. ADC driver initialization
 *
 * Call \ref adc_drv_init from your application initialization function.
 * This will initialize and register adc driver with the mdev interface.
 *
 * 3. Open ADC device to use
 *
 * \ref adc_drv_open() should be called once before using ADC hardware.
 * Here you will specify ADC number (from 0 to 1). The other parameters
 * that are set by default are -<br>
 * ADC_RESOLUTION_16BIT - Resolution 16 bit<br>
 * ADC_VREF_INTERNAL - Internal 1.2V reference<br>
 * ADC_GAIN_1 - PGA gain set to 1<br>
 * ADC_CLOCK_DIVIDER_32 - ADC clock divided by 32<br>
 * ADC_BIAS_FULL - Full biasing mode<br>
 *
 * If these defaults need to be changed they should be changed in
 * \ref adc_drv_open()
 *
 * \code
 * {
 *	mdev_t *adc_dev;
 *	adc_dev = adc_drv_open(ADC0_ID);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * 4. Get result/output of ADC
 *
 * Call \ref adc_drv_result() to get the output of the mentioned
 * adc.
 *
 * 5. Closing a device.
 *
 * A call to \ref adc_drv_close informs the ADC driver to release the
 * resources that it is holding.
