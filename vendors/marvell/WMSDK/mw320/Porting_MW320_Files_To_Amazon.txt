Please follow steps mentioned below so as to port Marvell specific files into amazon-freertos repository,

1. Download latest AFQP document from Amazon. Link - https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tests/Amazon%20FreeRTOS%20Qualification%20Developer%20Guide.pdf
2. Find link for git repository for amazon-freertos. Link - https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos
3. Download the expected version with the help of tag.
4. Extract appropriate Marvell release bundle.
5. This Marvell release bundle is arranged in sync with amazon-freertos folder structure.
6. Copy appropriate files and folders to respective locations in amazon-freertos,
	For example- copy Marvell_Bundle/test/mw300_rd to AFR_HOME/test/ in amazon-freertos git(working dirctory for testing or demo)
7. Same method can be followed for all files or folders present in Marvell release bundle. 
8. Once everything is in place follow Getting Started Guide for MW320.pdf.

Note : Cmake related files and folders are not present in master branch of amazon-freertos git. These changes are present in feature/cmake branch.
So all cmake related files and folders(cmake folder in AFR_HOME, CMakeLists.txt files for all modules, PreLoad.cmake) 
need to be copied from feature/cmake branch to working directory.

Also we need to skip AFQP_SOCKETS_Socket_InvalidTooManySockets from tcp. It is discussed with amazon.
So to skip, we use macro 'MW320'. We have defined it in FreeRTOSconfig.h.
To skip the test case add '&& !defined( MW320 )' in 'prvSOCKETS_Socket_InvalidTooManySockets' function in aws_test_tcp.c file.
For example,
#if !defined( WIN32 ) && !defined( PIC32MZ ) && !defined( ESP32 ) && !defined( ZYNQ7000 ) && !defined( MW320 ) && !defined( __RX ) /* Socket can be created as much as there is memory */
