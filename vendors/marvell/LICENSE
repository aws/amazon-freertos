        11.2 Licensee acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Marvell in an amount that may be difficult to ascertain and for which a remedy at law may be inadequate.

        11.3 This Agreement (and the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to their relationship under this Agreement) will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the United States and State of California, excluding its conflict of laws rules to the extent such rules would apply the law of another jurisdiction.

The exercise of any right or remedy provided in this Agreement will be without prejudice to the right to exercise any other right or remedy provided by law or equity, except as expressly limited by this Agreement. Failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
        11.6 If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give effect to the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement, will continue in full force and effect.
        11.7 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
