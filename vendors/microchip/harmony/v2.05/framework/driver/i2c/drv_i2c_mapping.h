 I2C Device Driver Interface Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_i2c_mapping.h

  Summary:
    I2C module driver mapping file interface header.

  Description:
    This file is a dummy file when the I2C driver is used in dynamic mode. 
	This file is included in drv_i2c.h. When I2C is used in static mode, the 
    drv_i2c_mapping.h contains driver functions with a hard-coded driver instance
	as the parameter. The APIs in drv_i2c.h acts as a wrapper around the calls
	to the specific driver instance.
