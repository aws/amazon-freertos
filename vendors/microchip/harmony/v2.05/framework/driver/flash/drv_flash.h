/*******************************************************************************
  Flash Driver Interface Declarations for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_flash.h

  Summary:
    Flash Driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The Flash device driver provides a simple interface to manage the Flash Controller on 
    Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the interface Declarations for the 
    Flash driver.
    
  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.
    
    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

  Summary:
    Initializes the Flash instance for the specified driver index.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Static</p>	

  Description:
    This function initializes the Flash Driver instance for the specified driver
    instance, making it ready for clients to use it. The initialization
    routine is specified by the MHC parameters.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized

    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Remarks:
    This function must be called before any other Flash function is called.
    This function should only be called once during system initialization.

/* Function
    void DRV_FLASH_WriteWord( const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint32_t flashAddr,  uint32_t sourceData)

   Summary:
    Writes a 4-byte Word to the Flash at the (word-aligned) flashAddr.
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> Static</p>

   Description:
    This function starts the process of programming a Word into the Flash.
    It does not wait for the write operation to be done, which is left to the user.
    It does not verify that the write was successful, which is left to the user.

   Precondition:
    The flashAddr is taken as a valid Flash address.  No range checking occurs.
    Any previous Flash operations (write or erase) must be completed or this will
    fail silently.
    The Flash must be correctly erased at flashAddr.

   Parameters:
    param1 const DRV_HANDLE handle	Drive handle returned from DRV_FLASH_Open
    param2 uint32_t flashAddr   This contains the address of the location where 
                               the data will be written.
    param3 uint32_t sourceData  This is the data which will be written to the Flash.

   Returns:
    None.

   Remarks:
    Most devices will be running for code stored in the Flash.  This means that any writes
    to the Flash will necessarily be writes to program space.  As such, they will prevent
    the CPU from reading further instructions until the write is done.  However, some devices
    may have more than one Flash such that it can run from one while writing to another.  
    Additionally, if the application is small enough, it may run out of a cache.  In any 
    case, it is up to the user to wait for an operation to complete and or to decide that 
    such a wait is unnecessary.

    Example:
    <code>
    flashAddr = 0x9d008000;
    sourceData = 0x12345678;
    DRV_FLASH_WriteWord(handle, flashAddr,  sourceData);

    This function starts the process of erasing a page of Flash.  It does not 
    wait for the erase operation to be done.  That is left to the user.
