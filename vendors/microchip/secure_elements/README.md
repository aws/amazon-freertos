CryptoAuthLib - Microchip CryptoAuthentication Library
====================================================

Introduction
------------------------
This code base implements an object-oriented C library which supports
Microchip CryptoAuth devices.  The family of devices supported currently are:

- [ATSHA204A](http://www.microchip.com/ATSHA204A)
- [ATECC108A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC108A)
- [ATECC508A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC508A)
- [ATECC608A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC608A)

Online documentation is at https://microchiptech.github.io/cryptoauthlib/

Latest software and examples can be found at:
  - http://www.microchip.com/SWLibraryWeb/product.aspx?product=CryptoAuthLib
  - https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthtools

Prerequisite skills:
  - strong C programming and code reading
  - Atmel Studio familiarity
  - Knowledge of flashing microcontrollers with new code
  - Familiarity with Microchip CryptoAuth device functionality

Prerequisite hardware to run CryptoAuthLib examples:
  - [ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro]( http://www.microchip.com/atsamr21-xpro )
    or [ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro]( http://www.microchip.com/ATSAMD21-XPRO )
  - [CryptoAuth Xplained Pro Extension](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=atcryptoauth-xpro-b )
    or [CryptoAuthentication SOIC Socket Board](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=at88ckscktsoic-xpro )
    to accept SOIC parts

For most development, using socketed top-boards is preferable until your
configuration is well tested, then you can commit it to a CryptoAuth Xplained
Pro Extension, for example. Keep in mind that once you lock a device, it will
not be changeable.

There are two major compiler defines that affect the operation of the library.
  - ATCA_NO_POLL can be used to revert to a non-polling mechanism for device
    responses. Normally responses are polled for after sending a command,
    giving quicker response times. However, if ATCA_NO_POLL is defined, then
    the library will simply delay the max execution time of a command before
    reading the response.
  - ATCA_NO_HEAP can be used to remove the use of malloc/free from the main
    library. This can be helpful for smaller MCUs that don't have a heap
    implemented. If just using the basic API, then there shouldn't be any code
    changes required. The lower-level API will no longer use the new/delete
    functions and the init/release functions should be used directly.

for, please contact us through the Microchip portal with your request.

CryptoAuthLib Architecture
----------------------------
See the 'docs' directory of CryptoAuthLib for supporting documentation
including architecture diagrams and more detailed usage docs.

The library is structured to support portability to:
  - multiple hardware/microcontroller platforms
  - multiple environments including bare-metal, Windows, and Linux OS
  - multiple chip communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, and SWI)

All platform dependencies are contained within the HAL (hardware abstraction
layer).

![CryptoAuthLib Architecture](./docs/CryptoAuthLib-Architecture.png "CryptoAuthLib Architecture" )

There are three primary object types in CryptoAuthLib:
  - Device (ATCADevice)
  - Command (ATCACommand)
  - Interface (ATCAIface)
  
ATCADevice is a composite object made up of ATCACommand ATCAIface.

![ATCADevice](./docs/cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCADevice.png "ATCADevice and ATCACommand object" )
![ATCAIface](./docs/cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCAIFace.png "ATCAIface object" )
![Hardware abstraction layer](./docs/cryptoauthlib-uml/ATCAHal.png "CryptoAuth hardware abstraction layer" )

Currently, the vast majority of testing has been performed on:

  - ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro
  - ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro
  - ATSAMV71 Xplained Pro
  - Windows (kit protocol HID)

These host containers implement a host test environment and
test console to exercise tests.  They presume that a CryptoAuth Xplained Pro
or other I2C socket for an ATECC608A/ATECC508A/ATECC108A/ATSHA204A are
connected to the I2C pins of the host Xplained Pro development board or in the
case of windows is using a HID connection to an  ATCK101 or ATCK590.

The unit tests and basic tests exercise the core datasheet commands of
the device as well as the more convenient, basic API methods.

If you need an example of how to use a command, these hosts and tests are a
good place to reference.

Object Architecture
--------------------------
Even though this is a C library, it follows object-oriented design patterns.

An object is minimally defined to be data and the actions which operate on that
data.

Each CryptoAuth device is a composite object, a structure which includes
the command table (list of commands) which are valid for the device, and the
data used to hold the state of that device.

ATCADevice is the object which represents the Microchip CryptAuth device

ATCACommand is the object which represents the valid methods of the Device.

ATCAInterface is the physical interface object (I2C or SWI instance).
Currently, each Device may have a single OATCAInterface.

ATCADevice represents an ATSHA or ATECC family device.

In order to add new protocol support for a platform, you provide a HAL
(hardware abstraction layer) C file for the protocol and target.  In your
project's IDE or Makefile, you select which HAL support you need for the 
hardware configuration.  Generally, there are separate files for each 
protocol and platform combination - (ie: samd21_i2c_asf.c would target SAMD21 
MCUs with I2C using the ASF low-level driver support.)

Directory Structure
-----------------------
```bash
docs - AppNotes and Doxygen HTML documentation for the library API. Load "docs/html/index.html" in your browser
lib - primary library source code
lib/atcacert - certificate data and i/o methods
lib/basic - the Basic API way to access the core classes
lib/crypto - Software crypto implementations (primarily SHA1 and SHA256)
lib/hal - hardware abstraction layer code for supporting specific platforms
lib/host - support functions for common host-side calculations
lib/jwt - json web token functions
test - unit tests. See test/cmd-processor.c for main() implementation.

For production code, test directories should be excluded by not compiling it
into a project, so it is up to the developer to include or not as needed.  Test
code adds significant bulk to an application - it's not intended to be included
in production code.
```

Tests
------------

There is a set of unit tests found in the test directory which will at least
partially demonstrate the use of the objects.  Some tests may depend upon a 
certain device being configured in a certain way and may not work for all
devices or specific configurations of the device.

The test/cmd-processor.c file contains a main() function for running the tests.
It implements a command-line interface. Typing help will bring up the list of
commands available.

One first selects a device type, with one of the following commands:
  - 204 (ATSHA204A)
  - 108 (ATECC108A)
  - 508 (ATECC508A)
  - 608 (ATECC608A)
  
From there the following unit test sweets are available:
  - unit (test command builder functions)
  - basic (test basic API functions)
  - cio (test certification i/o functions)
  - cd (test certificate data functions)
  - util (test utility functions)
  - crypto (test software crypto functions)
  
Unit tests available depend on the lock level of the device. The unit tests
won't lock the config or data zones automatically to allow retesting at desired
lock levels. Therefore, some commands will need to be repeated after locking
to exercise all available tests.

Starting from a blank device, the sequence of commands to exercise all unit
tests is:
```text
unit
basic
lockcfg
unit
basic
lockdata
unit
basic
cio
cd
util
crypto
```

Using CryptoAuthLib (Microchip CryptoAuth Library)
===========================================

Using a new library is often easier when you can load an example and see how 
it works.  We've provided examples in the form of "host containers" which are
host projects that incorporate CryptoAuthLib and target various processors
or communication APIs.

We maintain host test containers for each of the HAL layers we support.
We've published the host container for SAMD21 which demonstrates a simple
console interface to invoke test runners.

Look for SAMD21 Unit Tests CryptoAuthLib at
http://www.microchip.com/SWLibraryWeb/product.aspx?product=CryptoAuthLib

The best way to learn how to use CryptoAuthLib is to study the host test
projects that exercise the library and ATECC and ATSHA devices.

New examples will be forthcoming as the software matures.  Continue checking 
the [CryptoAuthentication](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/cryptoauthentication/overview) 
web page for new updates.

Using Git to Incorporate CryptoAuthLib as a Submodule
-----------------------------------
You can include this project in your own project under git.

Using CryptoAuthLib as a git submodule, you can maintain your application
separately from CryptoAuthLib.

If your project is already in git but you haven't yet intergrated 
CryptoAuthLib, change to the directory where you want to put CryptoAuthLib

```bash
git submodule add -b master <giturl to CryptoAuthLib>
```

This adds CryptoAuthLib as a subdirectory and separate git repo within your
own project.  Changes and commits to your project vs CryptoAuthLib will remain
separated into each respective repository.

If there is a project you want to checkout that already incorporates
CryptoAuthLib as a submodule if you clone the repo that incorporates
CryptoAuthLib, after cloning, you'll still need to fill out the CryptoAuthLib
submodule after cloning:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
cd cryptoauthlib
git checkout master
```

Now that CryptoAuthLib is a full-fledged submodule in your git project, in
order to easily add it to your project within Atmel Studio, please see this
[tip](http://avrstudio5.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/tip-add-existing-multiple-files-and-folders-to-an-avr-studio-project-quickly/)

Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a project
-----------------------------------------
1) In your Makefile or IDE, choose the HAL support you need from the HAL
   directory and exclude other HAL files from your project.

2) For I2C interfaces, define the symbol ATCA_HAL_I2C in your compiler's symbol
   definitions.  This will hook up the CryptoAuthLib interface class with your
   HAL implementation of I2C methods.

3) HAL implementations for CDC and HID interfaces to the ATCK101 are also
   included for use with Windows or Linux versions of the test host.

Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a Linux project using USB HID devices
-----------------------------------------
The Linux HID HAL files use the Linux udev development software package.

To install the udev development package under Ubuntu Linux, please type the
following command at the terminal window:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

This adds the udev development development software package to the Ubuntu Linux
installation.

The Linux HID HAL files also require a udev rule to be added to change the
permissions of the USB HID Devices.  Please add a new udev rule for the
Microchip CryptoAuth USB devices.

```bash
cd /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo touch mchp-cryptoauth.rules
```

Edit the mchp-cryptoauth.rules file and add the following line to the file:
```text
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2312", MODE="0666"
```
