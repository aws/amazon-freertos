   The main purpose of it is to keep hardware specifics from bleeding into the
   higher levels - hardware specifics could include things like framework
   specific items (ASF SERCOM) vs a non-Microchip I2C library constant that
   defines an I2C port. But I2C has roughly the same parameters regardless of
   architecture and framework.
