/**
 * \brief Perform the nessasary checks and copy data into an attribute structure
 *
 * The ulValueLen field is modified to hold the exact length of the specified attribute for the object.
 * In the special case of an attribute whose value is an array of attributes, for example CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE, where
 * it is passed in with pValue not NULL, then if the pValue of elements within the array is NULL_PTR then the
 * ulValueLen of elements within the array will be set to the required length. If the pValue of elements within the
 * array is not NULL_PTR, then the ulValueLen element of attributes within the array MUST reflect the space that
 * the corresponding pValue points to, and pValue is filled in if there is sufficient room.Therefore it is
 * important to initialize the contents of a buffer before calling C_GetAttributeValue to get such an array value.
 * If any ulValueLen within the array isn't large enough, it will be set to CK_UNAVAILABLE_INFORMATION and the
 * function will return CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, as it does if an attribute in the pTemplate argument has ulValueLen
 * too small Note that any attribute whose value is an array of attributes is identifiable by virtue of the
 * attribute type having the CKF_ARRAY_ATTRIBUTE bit set.
