 *
 * The GenKey command is used for creating ECC private keys, generating ECC
 * public keys, and for digest calculations involving public keys.
 *
 * \note List of devices that support this command - ATECC108A, ATECC508A,
 *       ATECC608A. There are differences in the modes that they support. Refer
 *       to device datasheets for full details.
