  File Name:
    system_interrupt.c

  Summary:
    Raw ISR definitions.

  Description:
    This file contains a definitions of the raw ISRs required to support the
    interrupt sub-system.

  Summary:
    This file contains source code for the interrupt vector functions in the
    system.

  Description:
    This file contains source code for the interrupt vector functions in the
    system.  It implements the system and part specific vector "stub" functions
    from which the individual "Tasks" functions are called for any modules
    executing interrupt-driven in the MPLAB Harmony system.

  Remarks:
    This file requires access to the systemObjects global data structure that
    contains the object handles to all MPLAB Harmony module objects executing
    interrupt-driven in the system.  These handles are passed into the individual
    module "Tasks" functions to identify the instance of the module to maintain.
