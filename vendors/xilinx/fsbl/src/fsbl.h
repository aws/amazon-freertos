* @note
*
* Flags in FSBL
*
* FSBL_PERF
*
* This Flag can be set at compilation time. This flag is set for
* measuring the performance of FSBL.That is the time taken to execute is
* measured.when this flag is set.Execution time with reference to
* global timer is taken here
*
* Total Execution time is the time taken for executing FSBL till handoff
* to any application .
* If there is a bitstream in the partition header then the
* execution time includes the copying of the bitstream to DDR
* (in case of SD/NAND bootmode)
* and programming the devcfg dma is accounted.
*
* FSBL provides two debug levels
* DEBUG GENERAL - fsbl_printf under this category will appear only when the
* FSBL_DEBUG flag is set during compilation
* DEBUG_INFO - fsbl_printf under this category will appear when the
* FSBL_DEBUG_INFO flag is set during compilation
* For a more detailed output log can be used.
* FSBL_DEBUG_RSA - Define this macro to print more detailed values used in
* RSA functions
* These macros are input to the fsbl_printf function
*
* DEBUG LEVELS
* FSBL_DEBUG level is level 1, when this flag is set all the fsbl_prints
* that are with the DEBUG_GENERAL argument are shown
* FSBL_DEBUG_INFO is level 2, when this flag is set during the
* compilation , the fsbl_printf with DEBUG_INFO will appear on the com port
*
* DEFAULT LEVEL
* By default no print messages will appear.
*
* NON_PS_INSTANTIATED_BITSTREAM
*
* FSBL will not enable the level shifters for a NON PS instantiated
* Bitstream.This flag can be set during compilation for a NON PS instantiated
* bitstream
*
* ECC_ENABLE
* This flag will be defined in the ps7_init.h file when ECC is enabled
* in the DDR configuration (XPS GUI)
*
* RSA_SUPPORT
* This flag is used to enable authentication feature
* Default this macro disabled, reason to avoid increase in code size
*
* MMC_SUPPORT
* This flag is used to enable MMC support feature
*
* JTAG_ENABLE_LEVEL_SHIFTERS
* FSBL will not enable the level shifters for jtag boot mode. This flag can be
* set during compilation for jtag boot mode to enable level shifters.
