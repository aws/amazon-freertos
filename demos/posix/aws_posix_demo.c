/**
 * @brief Demo intro: job distribution with actor model.
 *
 * This demo simulates job distribution with actor model.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model
 *
 * In this demo, vStartPOSIXDemo() first creates all mailboxes
 * which will be used by actors to send and receive messages.
 * Then it spins up two types of actors -- Dispatcher and Workers.
 *
 * Dispatcher -- Distributing sub-tasks to workers.
 *               Distribution is done by putting messages into each worker's inbox,
 *               which is essentially an mqueue. Dispatcher keeps distributing tasks
 *               until all intended tasks are distributed.
 *
 * Workers -- Take sub-tasks and perform predefined routine for each type of tasks.
 *
 * Upon finishing distributing all tasks, Dispatcher will send a "terminate" message to
 * each worker. vStartPOSIXDemo() will then join all actor threads and clean up mailboxes.
 *
 * @note A few assumptions are made in this demo, which a user might have to alter
 * if to adopt this model in a new application:
 *
 *  - The upper limit for MQUEUE_NUMBER_OF_WORKERS is set to 10.
 *    This is not due to physical constraint (e.g. memory), rather to make queue
 *    names end with a single digit number.
 *
 *  - Message enum is cast to char/uint8_t directly, with the assumption that
 *    the system is not going to have more than 254 messages, which is often true
 *    in practice. Could extend bits used in a message to either have more messages
 *    or include additional arguments for a message. Proper typecasting is needed
 *    in that case.
 *
 *  - The philosophy is "failure is expected". It is shown in both the way dispatcher
 *    delivers messages (i.e. messages can be dropped by worker(s)), and also the
 *    way workers process messages (i.e. workers do not inform dispatcher success or
 *    failure).
 *
 *  - Following the philosophy, dispatcher shall never use blocking calls to distribute
 *    tasks. The only exception made here is that dispatcher needs to make sure the
 *    successful delivery of "terminate" messages. So that, main thread could join
 *    all actor threads and finish the demo.
