 * Demo for showing the use of MQTT API with transport interface implementation based on the BLE connectivity layer
 * to send MQTT packets to cloud assisted by a companion mobile device.
 *
 * The Example establishes a BLE data transfer channel over BLE GATT connection with a companion mobile
 * device and uses MQTT APIs to create and send packets over the channel to a broker.
 * This example is single threaded and uses statically allocated
 * memory. It uses QoS0 by default for sending to and receiving messages from the broker.
 *
 * A smartphone application using the FreeRTOS companion mobile SDK, in BLE central role should scan and
 * connect to this device successfully, before starting the demo.
 * Broker endpoint and the thing name should be configured in demos/include/aws_clientcredential.h.
