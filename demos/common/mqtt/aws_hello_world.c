/**
 * @file aws_hello_world.c
 * @brief A simple MQTT double echo example.
 *
 * It creates an MQTT client that both subscribes to and publishes to the
 * same MQTT topic, as a result of which each time the MQTT client publishes
 * a message to the remote MQTT broker, the broker sends the same message back
 * to the client (the first echo).  If the MQTT client has not seen the message
 * before, it appends the string "ACK" to the message before publishing back to
 * the broker (the second echo).
 *
 * The double echo allows a complete round trip to be observed from the AWS IoT
 * console itself.  The user can subscribe to "freertos/demos/echo" topic from
 * the AWS IoT Console and when executing correctly, the user will see 12 pairs
 * of strings, one pair (two strings) every five seconds for a minute.  The first
 * string of each pair takes the form "Hello World n", where 'n' is an monotonically
 * increasing integer.  This is the string originally published by the MQTT client.
 * The second string of each pair takes the form "Hello World n ACK".  This is the
 * string published by the MQTT client after it has received the first string back
 * from the MQTT broker.  The broker also sends the second string back to the
 * client, but the client ignores messages that already contain "ACK", so the
 * back and forth stops there.
 *
 * The demo uses two tasks. The task implemented by
 * prvMQTTConnectAndPublishTask() creates the MQTT client, subscribes to the
 * broker specified by the clientcredentialMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT constant,
 * performs the publish operations, and cleans up all the used resources after
 * a minute of operation.  The task implemented by prvMessageEchoingTask()
 * appends "ACK" to strings received from the MQTT broker and publishes them
 * back to the broker.  Strings received from the MQTT broker are passed from
 * the MQTT callback function to prvMessageEchoingTask() over a FreeRTOS message
 * buffer.
