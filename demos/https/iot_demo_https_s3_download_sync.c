/**
 * This demonstates downloading a file from S3 using a pre-signed URL using the Amazon FreeRTOS HTTP Client library.
 * The HTTPS Client library is a generic HTTP/1.1 client library that be used to download files from other webservers as
 * well.
 *
 * A presigned URL is required to run this demo. Please see the demos/https/README.md for instructions on how to
 * generate one.
 *
 * The file is downloaded incrementally using HTTP Partial Content headers. This is done by requesting ranges of the
 * bytes in a file with the header: "Range: bytes=N-M", where N is the starting range and M is the ending range. The
 * S3 HTTP server will response with a 206 Partial Content type of response and the file byte range requested. Please
 * note that not all HTTP servers support a Partial Content download with a byte range.
