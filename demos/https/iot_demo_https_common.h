 * This is used to specify which parts of the file
 * we want to download. Let's say the maximum file size is what can fit in a 32 bit unsigned integer. 2^32 = 4294967296
 * which is 10 digits. The header value string is of the form: "bytes=N-M" where N and M are integers. So the length
 * of this string is strlen(N) + strlen(M) + strlen("bytes=-") + NULL terminator. Given the maximum number of digits is
 * 10 we get the maximum length of this header value as: 10 * 2 + 7 + 1.
