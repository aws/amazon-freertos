 * @brief A simple OTA update example.
 *
 * This example initializes the OTA agent to enable OTA updates via the
 * MQTT broker. It simply connects to the MQTT broker with the users
 * credentials and spins in an indefinite loop to allow MQTT messages to be
 * forwarded to the OTA agent for possible processing. The OTA agent does all
 * of the real work; checking to see if the message topic is one destined for
 * the OTA agent. If not, it is simply ignored.
