Mk_WicedFS - Image Creation Tool for Wiced Read Only File-System
================================================================

This directory contains source code for a tool which can create filesystem images for
the WicedFS filesystem.

The makefile generates two executables - with and without 64-bit support. (64 Bit support is required for files over 2GB)

The tool takes an existing directory on the host PC and creates a WicedFS filesystem image which contains all
the files and subdirectories of the supplied directory.
