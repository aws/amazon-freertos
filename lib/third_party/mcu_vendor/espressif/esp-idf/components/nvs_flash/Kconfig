config MP_BLOB_SUPPORT
    bool "Enable multi-page blob support"
    default n
    help
        When enabled, blobs larger than the sector size are split and stored on multiple sectors.
        This removes the earlier limitation of 1984 bytes for storing data-blobs.

config NVS_ENCRYPTION
   bool "Enable NVS encryption"
   default n
   depends on FLASH_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED
   help
      This option enables encryption for NVS. When enabled, AES-XTS is used to encrypt
      the complete NVS data, except the page headers. It requires XTS encryption keys 
      to be stored in an encrypted partition. This means enabling flash encryption is 
      a pre-requisite for this feature.
