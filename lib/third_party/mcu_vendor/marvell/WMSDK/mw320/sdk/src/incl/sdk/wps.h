*  @brief WPS - WiFi Protected Setup
*
*  Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a standard for easy and secure wireless
*  network set up and connections. Using this standard, wireless clients
*  can associate with the WPS enabled access point by entering the same
*  PIN at client and AP end or by pushing a pushbutton on both. This eliminates
*  the need for manually entering the security configuration on the client side.
*
*  Two methods that are supported by SDK are:
*
*  \li PIN Method: In this method the same PIN (Personal Identification Number)
*  is entered on the wireless client and access point. The PIN can be static
*  or dynamically generated on any of the AP or wireless client.
*  \li PBC Method: in which the user simply has to push a button, either
*  an actual or virtual one, on both the AP and wireless client.
*
*  \section wps_usage Usage
*  In a typical implementation WPS thread is started by calling \ref wps_start.
*  A valid initialized \ref wps_config structure needs to be passed to this
*  function. This structure contains a callback handler which is invoked by the
*  WPS thread on occurrence of various events. Once the WPS thread is started,
*  commands can be sent to it using \ref wps_connect function. Typically
*  these commands can be start PIN session, or start a pushbutton session. This
*  requires passing \ref wps_session_command structure that contains a valid
*  \ref wlan_scan_result that contains network information for a WPS enabled
*  wireless network. On successful WPS session, callback handler is invoked with
*  \ref WPS_SESSION_SUCCESSFUL event with \ref wlan_network structure that
*  contains all the security information for the network with which WPS
*  session was attempted. After this \ref wps_stop should be called to
*  terminate the WPS thread.
*
*  \note WPS implementation lets application decide PIN policy. PIN could either
*  be generated by the application, or by the access point or can be statically
*  generated at device manufacturing time. \ref wps_generate_pin and \ref
*  wps_validate_pin utility functions can be used by the application to generate
*  and validate PIN.
*
*  \note WPS thread internally uses multiple dynamic allocations. Please do not
*  reduce the heap size below 64KB if the application wishes to use WPS.
