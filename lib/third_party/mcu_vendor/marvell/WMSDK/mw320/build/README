Writing a Makefile
------------------
* A build.mk file defines the rules for building the application
* A typical build.mk file is shown below:

exec-y              += smart_plug
smart_plug-objs-y   := src/main.c src/plug.c
smart_plug-cflags-y := -I$(d)/src -D_ENABLE_FEATURE_X_

* A quick note about the above 3 lines:
  - We first define that a firmware named 'smart_plug' has to be
    generated. This is indicated by adding it to the 'exec-y'
    variable.
  - The objects that will be part of this firmware are defined by
    adding them to the 'smart_plug-objs-y' variable. Note that all the
    other libraries that are part of the SDK will automatically be
    used for the linking phase.
  - The compiler flags that should be included while compiling the
    above object files are defined with 'smart_plug-cflags-y'
    variable.
	- The special variable 'd' holds the path to the directory
	  where the build.mk file resides.

Other Options
-------------
Some of the other application specific options include:

* Custom board file:
smart_plug-board-y := src/smart_plug_v1.c

* Custom linker file:
smart_plug-linkerscript-y    := $(d)/src/smart_plug.ld

* Build FTFS:
smart_plug-ftfs-y        := smart_plug_v1.ftfs
smart_plug_v1-ftfs-dir-y := $(d)/www
smart_plug_v1-ftfs-api-y := 100
