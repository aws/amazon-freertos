> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

<span style="float:right;margin-right:4em"> &mdash; <i>Official description of HTTP from [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)</i></span><br>

This HTTP library implements a subset of the HTTP/1.1 standard for compatibility with the [AWS IoT HTTP Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/http.html) and the [AWS S3 HTTP Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectOps.html). It is also compatible with other HTTP servers. Feature of this library include: 
- Both fully asynchronous and synchronous (blocking) API functions.
- Application managed memory for internal context and HTTP formatted headers.
- Thread-aware and parallelized connections.

Currently, the HTTPS Client library has the following dependencies:
- The queue library for maintaining of list of pending requests and responses on the connection.
- The logging library may be used if @ref IOT_LOG_LEVEL_HTTPS is not @ref IOT_LOG_NONE.
- The platform layer provides an interface to the operating system for thread management, clock functions, networking, etc.

In addition to the components above, the HTTPS Client library also depends on C standard library headers.

/**
@page https_design Design
@brief Architecture behind the HTTPS library.

The HTTPS Client library will invoke a task pool worker to send a request. It will then receive the response during the network receive callback context. If there are more requests in the connection's request queue, it will schedule another task pool worker to send that request.

@page https_demo Demos
@brief The HTTPS Client demos demonstrates usage of the HTTPS Client library.

These demos shows downloading a file from S3 using a pre-signed URL using the Amazon FreeRTOS HTTP Client library. The HTTPS Client library is a generic HTTP/1.1 client library that be used to download files from other web servers as well.

See @subpage https_demo_usage for information on how to get the demo up and running.

The main HTTPS Client demo files are [iot_demo_https_s3_download_async.c](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos/https/iot_demo_https_s3_download_async.c) and [iot_demo_https_s3_download_sync.c](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos/https/iot_demo_https_s3_download_sync.c), which contain platform-independent code. See @ref building_demo for instructions on building the HTTPS Client demo.

<h2>iot_demo_https_s3_download_sync.c</h2>
@brief Synchronously download a file from S3 using a pre-signed URL.

This demo will use @ref https_client_function_sendsync to download the file specified in S3.

<h2>iot_demo_https_s3_download_async.c</h2>
@brief Asynchronously download a file from S3 using a pre-signed URL.

This demo will use @ref https_client_function_sendasync to download the file specified in S3.

See @subpage https_demo_config for configuration settings that change the behavior of the demo.

@brief The maximum number of inflight asynchronous requests. 

This configures the total number of requests in the pool of HTTPS Client library configurations and handles. In order to send 
   a request asynchronously the memory for both the request buffers and the response buffers must not be shared between 
   other asynchronous requests on the same connection. You can reuse the buffer only after the request/response process
   has been finished. It is finished when the responseCompleteCallback() is invoked. We create a pool of memory so that 
   all available requests in the pool can be scheduled right away without over-writing each other.

/**
@page https_tests Tests
@brief Tests written for the HTTPS Client library.

The HTTPS Client tests reside in the `tests` directory. They are divided into the following subdirectories:
- `access`: Helper files that allow access to internal variables and functions of the HTTPS Client library.
- `system`: HTTPS Client integration testing. These tests require a network connection.
- `unit`: HTTPS Client unit tests. These tests do not require a network connection.

See @subpage https_tests_config for configuration settings that change the behavior of the tests.

The current HTTPS Client tests use the [Unity test framework](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/). See @ref building_tests for a guide on running the tests.
