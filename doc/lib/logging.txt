@brief Generate and print log messages. <br><br>

This library allows other libraries to generate and print log messages, which can aid in debugging. Log messages are printed by passing strings to one of the [logging functions]( @ref logging_functions). The features of this library include:
- [Configurable levels](@ref logging_constants_levels) for log messages and libraries.
- Automatic printing of log level, library name, and time with every message. The information printed with each message [may be customized](@ref IotLogConfig_t).
- A [function to print the contents of buffers](@ref logging_function_printbuffer) when using the [debug](@ref IOT_LOG_DEBUG) log level. This allows the contents of memory to be easily examined.

Currently, the logging library has the following dependencies:
- The [platform clock component](@ref platform_clock) for [generating the timestring](@ref platform_clock_function_gettimestring) to print in log messages.
- When @ref IOT_STATIC_MEMORY_ONLY is `1`, the logging library depends on the [platform static memory component](@ref static_memory) to allocate buffers for log messages. When @ref IOT_STATIC_MEMORY_ONLY is `0`, the logging library will default to using the standard library's [malloc](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/malloc.html) and [free](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/free.html) functions. The logging library's memory allocation functions [may always be overridden](@ref logging_config_memory). Note that the logging library will silently discard logs if it fails to allocate memory for the message.

@section logging_setup_use Setup and use
@brief How to set up and use the logging library.

The file iot_logging_setup.h should be included to configure logging for a single source file. Before including iot_logging_setup.h, the constants @ref _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL and @ref _LIBRARY_LOG_NAME must be defined.

For example, to configure all the "SAMPLE" library to print all messages below the [info](@ref IOT_LOG_INFO) log level:

@code{c}
// Print log messages up to the "info" level.
#define _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL    IOT_LOG_INFO

// Print library name "SAMPLE".
#define _LIBRARY_LOG_NAME     "SAMPLE"

// Including this header defines the logging macros using _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL and
// _LIBRARY_LOG_NAME.
#include "iot_logging_setup.h"

int main( void )
{
    // After including iot_logging_setup.h, the logging functions can be used.
    IotLogError( "Error." );      // Will be printed because IOT_LOG_ERROR <= _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL
    IotLogWarn( "Warning. " );    // Will be printed because IOT_LOG_WARN <= _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL
    IotLogInfo( "Info." );        // Will be printed because IOT_LOG_INFO <= _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL
    IotLogDebug( "Debug." );      // Will not be printed because IOT_LOG_DEBUG > _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL

    return 0;
}
@endcode

The code above will print something like the following:

@code
[ERROR][SAMPLE][2018-01-01 12:00:00] Error.
[WARN ][SAMPLE][2018-01-01 12:00:00] Warning.
[INFO ][SAMPLE][2018-01-01 12:00:00] Info.
@endcode

@config_brief{logging library}

@section _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL
@brief The log level for a source file.

Sets the log level for a single source file. A log message will only be printed if its level is less than this setting.

Both this constant and @ref _LIBRARY_LOG_NAME must be defined before including iot_logging_setup.h. See @ref logging_setup_use for an example on how to use this setting.

@configpossible One of the @ref logging_constants_levels.
@note This value must be defined if iot_logging_setup.h is included. The library will not provide a default value for this setting.

@section _LIBRARY_LOG_NAME
@brief The library name printed in log messages.

Sets the library name for a single source file. By default, all log messages contain the library name. The library name may be disabled for a single log message by setting passing an #IotLogConfig_t with [hideLibraryName](@ref IotLogConfig_t.hideLibraryName) set to `true`.

Both this constant and @ref _LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL must be defined before including iot_logging_setup.h. See @ref logging_setup_use for an example on how to use this setting.

@configpossible Any string.
@note This value must be defined if iot_logging_setup.h is included. The library will not provide a default value for this setting.

@section IotLogging_Puts
@brief Logging library output function.

The logging library calls this function to print strings. Like the standard library's [puts](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/puts.html) function, this function should write a newline after the string, as log messages may not end with a newline. This setting provided the flexibility to log over different channels. For example, if no `stdout` is available, this function may be set to log over other channels such as UART or a network.

Although this function is supposed to return an `int`, the logging library does not check its return value. Therefore, a function with no return type is also acceptable.

@configpossible Any function with the same parameter as the standard library's [puts](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/puts.html) function. Since the logging library does not check the return value of this function, the return type may differ from [puts](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/puts.html).<br>
@configdefault Standard library [puts](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/puts.html) function.

@section logging_config_memory Memory allocation
@brief If @ref IOT_STATIC_MEMORY_ONLY is `1`, then the following functions must be re-implemented for the logging library.
- #IotLogging_Malloc <br>
  @copybrief IotLogging_Malloc
- #IotLogging_Free <br>
  @copybrief IotLogging_Free
- #IotLogging_StaticBufferSize <br>
  @copybrief IotLogging_StaticBufferSize

Note that the logging library will silently discard logs if it fails to allocate memory for the message.
