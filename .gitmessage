# Run git config commit.template .gitmessage
# Use git commit when committing files, and this template will be used.

# Example commit message:
# chore: Add commit message template

# Capitalize subject line.
# Write capitalized imperative statement with no period for subject
# List details of significant changes below the subject line
# Write details as capitalized imperative statements
# Provide the below sections for further context

# Why:

# A short imperative subject helps when viewing the log, especially when
# viewing one-line formatted logs.  Clear writing of what changed helps
# give a clean understanding of context when reading blame messages and
# when looking at a specific commit.

# Related Issues:
# Link to related issue numbers (hyper link if applicable), e.g.:
# git issue 123

# References:
# List relevant references e.g.:
# https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
