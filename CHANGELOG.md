## 202107.00 July 2021

### New Features

#### coreMQTT Agent v1.0.0

- The coreMQTT Agent library is a high level API that adds thread safety to the coreMQTT (https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) library. The library provides thread safe equivalents to the coreMQTT's APIs, greatly simplifying its use in multi-threaded environments. The coreMQTT Agent library manages the MQTT connection by serializing the access to the coreMQTT library and reducing implementation overhead. This allows your multi-threaded applications to share the same MQTT connection, and enables you to design an embedded application without having to worry about coreMQTT thread safety.
- See memory requirements for the latest release here (https://freertos.org/Documentation/api-ref/coreMQTT-Agent/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#core_mqtt_agent_memory_requirements)

### Updates

#### AWS IoT Over-the-air Update V3.0.0

- The AWS IoT Over-the-air update (OTA) (https://github.com/aws/ota-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to manage the notification of a newly available update, download the update, and perform cryptographic verification of the firmware update. Using the OTA library, you can logically separate firmware updates from the application running on your devices. You can also use the library to send other files (e.g. images, certificates) to one or more devices registered with AWS IoT. More details about OTA library can be found in AWS IoT Over-the-air Update documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-ota-dev.html).
- The AWS IoT Over-the-air update library has a dependency on coreJSON (https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreJSON) for parsing of JSON job document and tinyCBOR (https://github.com/intel/tinycbor) for decoding encoded data streams, other than the standard C library. It can be used with any MQTT library, HTTP library, and operating system (e.g. Linux, FreeRTOS). See demos to download firmware image over MQTT (using coreMQTT Agent) and over HTTP (using coreMQTT Agent and coreHTTP) using FreeRTOS at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/dev-guide-ota-workflow.html

#### AWS IoT Jobs v1.0.0

## 202012.00 December 2020

### New Features

#### coreHTTP v2.0.0

- The coreHTTP (https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreHTTP) library provides the ability to establish an HTTP connection with a server over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. The HTTP connection can be used to make "GET" (include range requests), "PUT", "POST" and "HEAD" requests. The library provides a mechanism to register a customer-defined callback for receiving parsed header fields in an HTTP response. The library has been refactored for memory optimization, and is a client implementation of a subset of the HTTP/1.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) standard.
- See memory requirements for the latest release here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreHTTP/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#http_memory_requirements).

#### backoffAlgorithm v1.0.0

- The backoffAlgorithm (https://github.com/FreeRTOS/backoffAlgorithm) library is a utility library to calculate backoff period for network operation retries (like failed network connection with server) using an exponential backoff with jitter algorithm. This library uses the "Full Jitter" strategy for the exponential backoff with jitter algorithm. More information about the algorithm can be seen in the Exponential Backoff and Jitter (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) AWS blog.
- Exponential backoff with jitter is typically used when retrying a failed connection or network operation with the server. An exponential backoff with jitter helps to mitigate the request failures made to servers, that are caused due to network congestion or high load on the server, by spreading out retry requests across multiple devices. Besides, in an environment with poor connectivity, a client can get disconnected at any time. A backoff strategy helps the client to conserve battery by not repeatedly attempting reconnections when they are unlikely to succeed.
- The backoffAlgorithm library has no dependencies on libraries other than the standard C library.

#### AWS IoT Device Defender v1.0.1

- The AWS IoT Device Defender (https://github.com/aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to interact with the AWS IoT Device Defender service to continuously monitor security metrics from devices for deviations from what you have defined as appropriate behavior for each device. If something doesn’t look right, AWS IoT Device Defender sends out an alert so you can take action to remediate the issue. More details about Device Defender can be found in AWS IoT Device Defender documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender.html).
- The AWS IoT Device Defender library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see demos (https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos/device_defender_for_aws) with coreMQTT and coreJSON).
- See memory requirements for the latest release here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#defender_memory_requirements).

#### AWS IoT Jobs v1.0.0

- The AWS IoT Jobs (https://github.com/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to interact with the AWS IoT Jobs service which notifies one or more connected devices of a pending “Job”. A Job can be used to manage your fleet of devices, update firmware and security certificates on your devices, or perform administrative tasks such as restarting devices and performing diagnostics. For documentation of the service, please see the AWS IoT Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html). Interactions with the Jobs service use the MQTT protocol. This library provides an API to compose and recognize the MQTT topic strings used by the Jobs service.
- The AWS IoT Jobs library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see demos (https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos/jobs_for_aws) with coreMQTT and coreJSON).
- See memory requirements for the latest release (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#jobs_memory_requirements)here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#jobs_memory_requirements).

#### HTTP Compatibility Layer v1.2.0

- The HTTP Compatibility Layer provides backwards compatibility from coreHTTP library to HTTPS V1.x.x APIs. In addition, the HTTP Compatibility Layer maintains the dependency of the network abstraction and linear containers from the HTTPS V1.x.x library. The task pool dependency is removed in order to allow the user to allocate tasks on the stack rather than exclusively on the heap.
- Configuration settings using C preprocessor constants, for the HTTP Compatibility Layer, are available in addition to the original configurations of the HTTPS V1.x.x library (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/html2/https/https_config.html). They can be set with a #define in the config file (iot_config.h) or by using a compiler option such as -D in gcc. If a configuration setting is not defined, the HTTP Compatibility Layer will use a "sensible" default value (unless otherwise noted). Because they are compile-time constants, this HTTP Compatibility Layer must be rebuilt if a configuration setting is changed.
    - IOT_HTTPS_DISPATCH_QUEUE_SIZE - The number of requests in the queue that are ready to be sent to the HTTP server.
    - IOT_HTTPS_DISPATCH_TASK_COUNT - The number of tasks that are responsible for sending requests from the dispatch queue.
    - IOT_HTTPS_DISPATCH_TASK_STACK_SIZE - The stack size of each dispatch task, sized appropriately for each board.
    - IOT_HTTPS_DISPATCH_USE_STATIC_MEMORY - If set to 1, the memory used by the dispatch task will be allocated statically by the library. Otherwise, memory will be allocated on the heap.
    - IOT_HTTPS_DISPATCH_TASK_PRIORITY - The priority of each dispatch task. This priority is deliberately chosen to match the original taskpool's priority. Doing so prevents starvation of the network-receive task and tasks potentially used by other libraries.
- See memory requirements for the latest release (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#jobs_memory_requirements) here (https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/libraries/c_sdk/standard/https/CODESIZE.md).

- Additional details can be found here: https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/V10.4.3-kernel-only/History.txt

#### FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP v2.3.2

- When a protocol error occurs during the SYN-phase of a TCP connection, a child socket will now be closed (calling FreeRTOS_closesocket() ), instead of being given the eCLOSE_WAIT status.  A client socket, which calls connect() to establish a connection, will receive the eCLOSE_WAIT status, just like before.

## 202011.01 December 2020

This release does not change any source files compared to 202011.00. It only fixes an issue with `checksums.json` file used by AWS IoT Device Tester to verify the integrity of FreeRTOS source files during the qualification process. This issue was present only on Windows while Linux and MacOS were unaffected.

## 202011.00 November 2020

### New Features

This release includes refactored MQTT, JSON Parser, and AWS IoT Device Shadow libraries for optimized memory usage and modularity, and includes dependent libraries via GitHub submoduling. These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score over 8, and checks against the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx). Deviations from the MISRA C:2012 guidelines are documented under [MISRA Deviations](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/202009.00/MISRA.md). These libraries have also undergone both static code analysis from [Coverity static analysis](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/202009.00/MISRA.md), and validation of memory safety and functional correction proofs through the CBMC automated reasoning tool.

The MQTT library in this release, coreMQTT, supports backward compatibility with the MQTT library in FreeRTOS version 201906.00 or higher via a [compatibility layer](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/202011.00/libraries/c_sdk/standard/mqtt). Therefore, MQTT-dependent libraries in FreeRTOS version 201906.00 or higher, including AWS IoT Device Shadow, AWS IoT Device Defender, and Greengrass Discovery, can use the coreMQTT library via the compatibility layer.

#### AWS IoT Device Shadow V1.0.1

- The [AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://github.com/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to store and retrieve the current state (the “shadow”) of every registered device. The device’s shadow is a persistent, virtual representation of your device that you can interact with from AWS IoT Core even if the device is offline. The device state captured as its “shadow” is itself a JSON document. The device can send commands over MQTT or HTTP to update its latest state. Each device’s shadow is uniquely identified by the name of the corresponding “thing”, a representation of a specific device or logical entity on AWS IoT. More details about AWS IoT Device Shadow can be found in [AWS IoT documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html).
- The AWS IoT Device Shadow library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see [demos](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/master/demos/shadow) with coreMQTT and coreJSON).
- See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#shadow_memory_requirements).

#### coreJSON V2.0.0

- The [coreJSON](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreJSON) library is a JSON parser that strictly enforces the [ECMA-404 JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). It provides a function to validate a JSON document, and a function to search for a key and return its value. A search can descend into nested structures using a compound query key. A JSON document validation also checks for illegal UTF8 encodings and illegal Unicode escape sequences.
- See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreJSON/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#json_memory_requirements).

#### coreMQTT V1.0.1

- The [coreMQTT](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) library provides the ability to establish an MQTT connection with a broker over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. This MQTT connection can be used for performing publish operations to MQTT topics and subscribing to MQTT topics. The library provides a mechanism to register customer-defined callbacks for receiving incoming PUBLISH, acknowledgement and keep-alive response events from the broker. The library has been refactored for memory optimization and is compliant with the [MQTT 3.1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html) standard. It has no dependencies on any additional libraries other than the standard C library, a customer-implemented network transport interface, and optionally a customer-implemented platform time function. The refactored design embraces different use-cases, ranging from resource-constrained platforms using only QoS 0 MQTT PUBLISH messages to resource-rich platforms using QoS 2 MQTT PUBLISH over TLS connections.
- See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreMQTT/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#mqtt_memory_requirements).

#### OTA PAL for Renesas Starter Kit + RX65N-2MB

### Updates

#### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) V5.1.0

- Added ACL connection state change callback for BLE HAL

#### Bluetooth Low Energy Management Library V2.2.0

- Added transport interface for BLE library to send data to AWS IoT using the coreMQTT and AWS IoT Device Shadow client libraries. The transport interface utilizes a companion device mobile application implemented using FreeRTOS BLE Android and iOS SDKs to send data to AWS IoT.
- Added coreMQTT and AWS IoT Device Shadow demos for BLE. The respective demos "MQTT BLE Transport Demo" and "Shadow BLE Transport Demo" can be found under `demos/ble` folder. The demo uses the new MQTT and Shadow client libraries and the BLE transport interface to send and receive data with AWS IoT.

#### FreeRTOS+TCP V2.3.1

- Sub-moduled to the [FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP) repository. This is a breaking change for users using 202007.00 release of amazon-freertos due to change in folder structure.
- Bug Fix for UDP only (`ipconfigUSE_TCP == 0`) compilation of FreeRTOS+TCP. Conditional compilation on the value of `ipconfigUSE_TCP` updated to exclude TCP only components.
- Added descriptions for functions and variables in Doxygen compatible format.
- Updated `prvParseDNSReply` function signature.

#### FreeRTOS+POSIX Utils V1.2.0

- The `iot_pki_utils.h` and `iot_pki_utils.c` are renamed to `core_pki_utils.h` and `core_pki_utils.c` respectively. They are also now a part of the corePKCS11 repository.

#### Greengrass Discovery V2.0.2

- Added more logging in library.

#### MQTT Client Library V2.3.0

- Refactored as compatibility layer for V2.x.x MQTT APIs using coreMQTT library. This is the library that supports backward compatibility with MQTT APIs present in between 201906.00 and 202007.00.

#### Over the Air Update V1.2.1

- Added check to abort the update if updating job status as self-test in service fails, this helps in early detection of mismatch in device and jobs states before activating new image.

#### PKCS11 V2.1.1

- Sub-moduled to the [FreeRTOS/corePKCS11](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/corePKCS11) repository.

#### OTA PAL for Microchip Curiosity PIC32MZEF

- Changed default configuration for number and size of blocks to be compatible with the size of the mbedTLS input buffer.

## 202007.00 July 2020

### New Features

#### Over the Air Update V1.2.0

- Updated the over-the-air (OTA) agent with the ability to pause and resume an in-progress update.
- Updated the OTA demo to demonstrate how to suspend an in-progress OTA update should the MQTT connection disconnect, then resume the same update when the MQTT connection reconnects. In line with best practice, the reconnect logic uses an exponential backoff and jitter algorithm to prevent the MQTT server getting overwhelmed with connection requests if a fleet of devices get disconnected and then attempt to reconnect at the same time.
- For testing purposes only, it is now possible to use the OTA agent to downgrade a version number or revert to an older version.  This new functionality is disabled by default.

#### New Board: Cypress PSoC 64 Standard Secure AWS Wi-Fi Bluetooth Pioneer Kit
- New Board: The <b>Cypress PSoC 64</b> board is now qualified with FreeRTOS.

#### New Board: ESP32-WROOM-32SE

- New Board: <b>ESP32-WROOM-32SE</b> is now available in the FreeRTOS Console.

### Updates

#### FreeRTOS+POSIX Utils V1.2.0

- Update the UTILS_TimespecAdd utility function to support both signed and unsigned definitions of `struct timespec.tv_sec`. (Some implementations use unsigned definition of `struct timespec.tv_sec` to address the *2038* problem on 32-bit systems. ) This change is backwards compatible.

#### MQTT Client Library V2.2.0

- Improved the Keep-Alive mechanism: The MQTT library will not send PING requests when connection is not idle, which fixes a disconnect issue during OTA. In prior versions, MQTT would sometimes disconnect during OTA due to timeouts for server PING response.
- Bug fix for Keep-Alive interval: The MQTT library was incorrectly sending PING requests at intervals greater than the keep alive period sent in the CONNECT request. This change fixes the problem.

#### Secure Sockets LwIP V1.2.0

- Fix invalid memory access - ss_ctx_t context is shared and sent to a user callback. If the socket is closed and subsequently freed during callback execution, the callback can potentially access the invalid context.
- Fix two separate issues for potential invalid memory access; at one place by validating socket handle before de-referencing, and at another place by freeing memory only if it had been previously allocated.

#### PKCS#11 V2.1.0

- Added doxygen to various PKCS #11 files.
- Added improved logging for mbed TLS  return codes in iot_pkcs11_mbedtls.c.

#### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) V5.0.0

- Change status parameter type for GATT Client callbacks to match Bluetooth 5.0.
- Add pxMultiAdvSetInstRawData API to set raw advertisement data for multi-advertisement instances.
- Mark pxBondedCb callback and ucTimeout variables as deprecated.

#### Bluetooth Low Energy Management Library V2.1.0

- Added new API IotBle_SetDeviceName() to set the BLE device name at runtime.
- Fixed IotBle_On() and IotBle_Off() APIs.
- Accommodate larger-than-expected writes to RXLargeMesg Gatt characteristic.

#### FreeRTOS+TCP V2.3.0

- Added ability to cache multiple IP addresses per DNS entry.
- Defensive security improvements:
    - In compliance with the UDP protocol specification, prior versions of FreeRTOS+TCP accepted UDP packets that had their checksum set to 0. FreeRTOS+TCP V2.3.0 adds a new configuration parameter, `ipconfigUDP_PASS_ZERO_CHECKSUM_PACKETS`, that enables users to opt to drop UDP packets that have their checksum set to 0. **Note:** This new setting defaults to 0, so it defaults to dropping UDP packets that have their checksum set to 0.
    - Prior versions of FreeRTOS+TCP accept IP packets that contain IP options, although those options are not processed. FreeRTOS+TCP V2.3.0 adds a new configuration parameter, `ipconfigIP_PASS_PACKETS_WITH_IP_OPTIONS`, that enables users to opt to drop IP packets that contain IP options.
    - Setting configuration parameter, `ipconfigDRIVER_INCLUDED_RX_IP_CHECKSUM`, to 1 offloads IP checksum and length checking to the hardware. From FreeRTOS+TCP V2.3.0, the length is checked in software even when it has already been checked in hardware.

#### Mbed TLS v2.16.7

- Upgraded the version of Mbed TLS to v2.16.7.
- Replaced copy of Mbed TLS with a submodule reference to the official [Mbed TLS GitHub repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.16.7).

#### Over the Air Update V1.2.0

- Fixed an issue encountered when an OTA job is force cancelled while the related download is in progress. It was caused due to the self-start timer starting after the OTA job document is received. The fix starts the self-start timer when the OTA agent on the device starts.

#### Espressif

- Support OTA via HTTP over the BLE channel for ESP32 (when SPIRAM is enabled).
- Added ESP-IDF component for WiFi provisioning in SoftAP mode. This allows provisioning devices with Wi-Fi credentials via a web-server running on the device and a provisioning mobile application.  This mode requires the use of lwIP as the networking stack.
- Replaced ESP-IDF code to be a submodule pointer to the official ESP-IDF repository.
- Updated LwIP as the default networking stack.

#### FreeRTOS+TCP V2.0.8
- Update the Zynq-7000 portable layer for receive descriptor alignment.

#### PKCS #11 Updates
Update mbedTLS-based PKCS #11, and PKCS #11 PAL. These changes have been made to more closely align with the PKCS #11 standard, respond to feedback from users and partners, and make it easy for users to go to production from a prototype.
Applications calling into PKCS #11 functions directly (rather than indirectly via an Amazon provided secure sockets or TLS layer) may experience breaking changes.

##### mbedTLS-based PKCS #11
- C_Initialize handles initialization of randomness in an effort to minimize entropy generation (or seed access) every time sessions are created and destroyed.  To protect random values, thread safety has been enabled in mbedTLS.
- C_SignInit and C_VerifyInit utilize the key handle that is passed in, rather than the first key found in order to comply with the PKCS #11 standard
- C_FindObject APIs no longer instantiate keys from the aws_clientcredential_keys.h header file if keys are not found. This removes the dependency of PKCS #11 on values that will be unique per-device (a transition step for enabling production-scale provisioning). Note that calling vDevModeKeyProvisioning() is now necessary to provision the device.
- C_FindObject PKCS #11 objects can be looked up by CKA_LABEL, in order to provide a standard-compliant object lookup.  Note that pkcs11configFILE_NAME_* configurations have been removed from aws_pkcs11_config.h, see aws_pkcs11.h for pkcs11configLABEL_* defines to access labels, and aws_pkcs11_pal.c for pkcs11palFILE_NAME_* defines.
- C_FindObject and C_GetAttributeValue accept different attribute arguments.
- C_CreateObject requires DER encoded certificates and keys instead of PEM formatted and object attributes required for creating objects have changed.  Note that vDevModeKeyProvisioning() has been updated to supply required attributes and convert inputs from DER to PEM if necessary.
- C_GenerateKeyPair now stores keys in non-volatile memory.
- C_Finalize is no longer invoked by helper functions to prevent threads from interfering with each other's PKCS #11 instances.
- Some error codes have been changes to better match the PKCS #11 standard.
- aws_tls.c and PKCS #11 AFQP tests have updates to reflect these changes.
    - mbedTLS-based PKCS #11 V1.0.5
    - TLS V1.1.3

##### PKCS #11 PAL for mbedTLS-based PKCS #11
- Breaking changes were made to PAL PKCS #11 functions in order to transition from file-centric API to object handle and object label based API.
    - PKCS #11 PAL for ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT V1.0.1
    - PKCS #11 PAL for XMC4800 IoT Kit V1.0.1
    - PKCS #11 PAL for Curiosity PIC32MZEF V1.0.4
    - PKCS #11 PAL for LPC54018 IoT Module V1.0.3

    - PKCS #11 PAL for STM32L4 Discovery kit IoT node V1.0.3
    - PKCS #11 PAL for Xilinx Zynq MicroZed V1.0.0 (new)

##### PKCS #11 for CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL
- Updates to match behavior of mbedTLS-based PKCS #11.
- mbedTLS added to support conversion between DER and PEM objects.  Note that after provisioning the device, mbedTLS and provisiong PKCS #11 functions may be removed to reduce code size.
    - PKCS #11 PAL for CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL V1.0.3

##### OTA PAL Updates
- The OTA PALs for the Curiosity PIC32MZEF and ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT boards have been modified to utilize PKCS #11 API to retrieve code signing keys, rather than calling into PKCS #11 PAL functions.
    - OTA PAL for Curiosity PIC32MZEF V1.0.1
    - OTA PAL for ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT V1.0.1

#### Secure Socket for FreeRTOS+TCP V1.1.4
- Minor update to handle PKCS #11 error codes.
- Update formatting.
