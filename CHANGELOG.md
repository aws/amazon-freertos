### Updates

#### mbedTLS Library

#### FreeRTOS+POSIX V1.0.1
- Minor bug fixes.

#### FreeRTOS+TCP V2.0.8
- Update the Zynq-7000 portable layer for receive descriptor alignment.

#### PKCS #11 Updates
Update mbedTLS-based PKCS #11, and PKCS #11 PAL. These changes have been made to more closely align with the PKCS #11 standard, respond to feedback from users and partners, and make it easy for users to go to production from a prototype.
Applications calling into PKCS #11 functions directly (rather than indirectly via an Amazon provided secure sockets or TLS layer) may experience breaking changes. 

##### mbedTLS-based PKCS #11
- C_Initialize handles initialization of randomness in an effort to minimize entropy generation (or seed access) every time sessions are created and destroyed.  To protect random values, thread safety has been enabled in mbedTLS.
- C_SignInit and C_VerifyInit utilize the key handle that is passed in, rather than the first key found in order to comply with the PKCS #11 standard
- C_FindObject APIs no longer instantiate keys from the aws_clientcredential_keys.h header file if keys are not found. This removes the dependency of PKCS #11 on values that will be unique per-device (a transition step for enabling production-scale provisioning). Note that calling vDevModeKeyProvisioning() is now necessary to provision the device.
- C_FindObject PKCS #11 objects can be looked up by CKA_LABEL, in order to provide a standard-compliant object lookup.  Note that pkcs11configFILE_NAME_* configurations have been removed from aws_pkcs11_config.h, see iot_pkcs11.h for pkcs11configLABEL_* defines to access labels, and iot_pkcs11_pal.c for pkcs11palFILE_NAME_* defines.
- C_FindObject and C_GetAttributeValue accept different attribute arguments.
- C_CreateObject requires DER encoded certificates and keys instead of PEM formatted and object attributes required for creating objects have changed.  Note that vDevModeKeyProvisioning() has been updated to supply required attributes and convert inputs from DER to PEM if necessary.
- C_GenerateKeyPair now stores keys in non-volatile memory.
- C_Finalize is no longer invoked by helper functions to prevent threads from interfering with each other's PKCS #11 instances.
- Some error codes have been changes to better match the PKCS #11 standard.
- iot_tls.c and PKCS #11 AFQP tests have updates to reflect these changes.
    - mbedTLS-based PKCS #11 V1.0.5
    - TLS V1.1.3

##### PKCS #11 PAL for mbedTLS-based PKCS #11
- Breaking changes were made to PAL PKCS #11 functions in order to transition from file-centric API to object handle and object label based API.
    - PKCS #11 PAL for ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT V1.0.1
    - PKCS #11 PAL for XMC4800 IoT Kit V1.0.1
    - PKCS #11 PAL for Curiosity PIC32MZEF V1.0.4
    - PKCS #11 PAL for LPC54018 IoT Module V1.0.3
    - PKCS #11 PAL for Windows Simulator V1.0.3
    - PKCS #11 PAL for STM32L4 Discovery kit IoT node V1.0.3
    - PKCS #11 PAL for Xilinx Zynq MicroZed V1.0.0 (new)

##### PKCS #11 for CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL
- Updates to match behavior of mbedTLS-based PKCS #11. 
- mbedTLS added to support conversion between DER and PEM objects.  Note that after provisioning the device, mbedTLS and provisiong PKCS #11 functions may be removed to reduce code size.
    - PKCS #11 PAL for CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL V1.0.3

##### OTA PAL Updates
- The OTA PALs for the Curiosity PIC32MZEF and ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT boards have been modified to utilize PKCS #11 API to retrieve code signing keys, rather than calling into PKCS #11 PAL functions. 
    - OTA PAL for Curiosity PIC32MZEF V1.0.1
    - OTA PAL for ESP32-DevKitC ESP-WROVER-KIT V1.0.1

#### Secure Socket for FreeRTOS+TCP V1.1.4
- Minor update to handle PKCS #11 error codes.
- Update formatting.

#### Secure Sockets for Infineon XMC4800 IoT Connectivity Kit V1.0.1
- Fix the license header from Secure Socket to Secure Sockets.

#### Secure Sockets for STM32L4 Discovery kit IoT node V1.0.0 Beta 4
- Bug fix to support Amazon Trust Services endpoints. For more information, please see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/aws-iot-core-ats-endpoints/.

#### Secure Sockets for CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL V1.0.5
- Remove duplicate file name definitions.  See aws_secure_sockets_config.h for file name defines.

#### Shadow V1.0.5
- Minor bug fixes.

### New Features

#### Demo Bootloader for Microchip Curiosity PIC32MZEF V1.0.0
The demo bootloader supports Amazon FreeRTOS over-the-air (OTA) update by implementing firmware version checking, cryptographic signature verification, and application self-test. The firmware verification includes verifying the authenticity and integrity of the new firmware received over the air. The bootloader verifies the cryptographic signature of the application before boot. The elliptic-curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) with SHA256 is used. The utilities provided can be used to generate a signed application that can be flashed on the device. This enables signature verification of the initial image.

## V1.3.0 07/31/2018

### New Features

#### AFQP 1.0 Support
This release of AFR has support for vendors who wish to have their ports qualified for Amazon FreeRTOS through the Amazon FreeRTOS Qualification Program (AFQP). This is the first public release of AFQP tests and documentation. A new top level "tests" directory is added to support this functionality. AFQP documents are available in "tests" directory. [Learn more.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-qualification-program.html)

#### Device Defender 1.0 Support
AWS IoT Device Defender is an AWS IoT security service that allows users to audit the configuration of their devices, monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior, and to mitigate security risks. It gives you the ability to enforce consistent security policies across your AWS IoT device fleet and respond quickly when devices are compromised. Device side support of this feature is part of this release. Devices supported are WinSim and Microchip PIC32MZEF. [Learn more.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/afr-device-defender-library.html)

#### FreeRTOS+POSIX 1.0 Interface
This release includes version 1.0.0 of FreeRTOS+POSIX.  FreeRTOS+POSIX is a POSIX compatibility layer that allows existing POSIX applications to run without modifications of FreeRTOS.  This release supports POSIX threads, mutexes, barriers, condition variables, semaphores, message queues, clocks, timers, and error numbers.  While most of the POSIX functions are implemented and up to specification, limitations in the FreeRTOS kernel precluded the standard implementations of certain functions.  The functions which differ from the POSIX specification are identified in their header files. Currently, FreeRTOS+POSIX is only used by drivers of the TI CC3220SF.
